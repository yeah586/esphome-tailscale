# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
once a `1.0.0` release is cut. While the version is still in the `0.x` range,
**minor version bumps may include breaking changes** — pin to a specific tag
(not `ref: main`) in your `packages:` block if you need stability.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`netmap_buffer_kb`: fit the netmap fetch on a small-PSRAM board** ([#45](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/45)). Fetching the tailnet map allocates two PSRAM buffers — HTTP/2 receive and JSON parse — sized by a compile-time Kconfig default of 512 KB each, chosen for 300+ peer tailnets. On a 2 MB-PSRAM board, or one sharing PSRAM with a display/audio pipeline, ~1 MB of contiguous PSRAM is not there: the allocation returns NULL and every netmap fetch fails, so the device registers successfully and then never connects. The new option sets both buffers from YAML (`netmap_buffer_kb: 128` is ample below ~50 peers). **Unset by default** — existing builds keep the 512 KB sizing and a manual `sdkconfig_options` override still wins, so nothing changes for anyone not setting it.

### Fixed
- **Task-watchdog reboot loop under a sustained DISCO exchange** ([#46](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/46)). When a peer keeps probing — the observed case is another microlink node whose WireGuard session with this one never completes, so neither side backs off — the DISCO/WireGuard manager task (priority 7, same core as ESPHome's priority-1 main loop) drained its queues until they were empty before sleeping, and under that load they never were: each packet costs an X25519 decrypt plus a reply and several log lines, packets arrived faster than that, the main loop got no CPU for more than 5 s, and the task watchdog aborted the device. Because the abort lands before app-verify, ESP-IDF then rolled the OTA back, so the visible symptom was "the update reverted itself" with a crash decoder blaming whatever the core happened to be executing (usually the DISCO decrypt). Two changes: the manager now processes a bounded burst of packets within a 40 ms budget per iteration and always reaches its 10 ms sleep, so lower-priority tasks are guaranteed a share of the core no matter what a peer sends; and the per-packet DISCO lines (`DISCO RX`, `DISCO PING`/`PONG`, `CallMeMaybe`, `CMM endpoint`/`probe`, `WG endpoint stored`, `UDP RX`, `DERP RecvPacket`) moved from INFO to DEBUG — the same treatment v0.5.6 gave `PONG sent` / `DERP TX` — replaced by one INFO line per 10 s (`DISCO: N packets in 10 s, M iterations budget-capped`) that keeps a storm visible. Diagnosed with a wired UART capture: the ESPHome API log stream loses the last lines before an abort, and those lines are the task-watchdog report. Reproduces on the released v0.5.6, so this is not a regression; the never-completing session between two microlink nodes is a separate defect tracked in the same issue.
- **A failed netmap-buffer allocation now says so, instead of looping on "MapRequest failed, will retry"** ([#45](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/45)). `ml_psram_malloc()` returning NULL was completely silent: the caller returned `-1` and the state machine logged the same generic retry line it logs for a network failure — except it fired a millisecond after the request was sent, which no round-trip failure can do. Diagnosing it needed the source. All four control-plane allocation sites (HTTP/2 receive, JSON parse, per-frame buffer, long-poll accumulator) now log what was requested against the PSRAM and internal free size *and* the largest free block, and name the knob to lower. The component additionally checks the configured buffer sizes against free PSRAM at boot and warns before the first fetch, since by the time the fetch fails the device looks healthy in every other respect.
- **Peers removed by the control plane now disappear immediately instead of at the next full netmap** ([#42](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/42)). `MapResponse.PeersRemoved` is an array of NodeIDs (integers) per `tailcfg`, and that is what both Tailscale and Headscale send — but the parser expected `nodekey:` strings and silently skipped every element. A node deleted from the tailnet (or otherwise removed) therefore stayed in the peer table, kept being probed and DISCO-pinged, and only went away when a full netmap arrived (reconnect or reboot) and the v0.5.5 authoritative sweep caught it — which on a stable connection can take days. Numeric entries are now resolved by NodeID (the string form is kept as a fallback). Verified on Headscale: deleting a node while the device is connected now removes the peer and its NVS cache entry within a second (`Peer removed: … ` + `Removing cached peer: …`), with no reconnect needed, and it stays gone across a reboot. Found running the v0.5.6 release tests; the handler has been like this since the initial vendoring, so every earlier release is affected.

## [0.5.6] — 2026-09-01

### Added
- **`ipn_version`: opt-in client-version string for the admin console** ([#39](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/pull/39), by [@timmills](https://github.com/timmills)). The Tailscale admin console gates some device operations (reassigning a node's address, for one) on the reported client version, and with the field empty a perfectly healthy node gets "Device is too old, please upgrade it". The component still reports **no version by default** — a public client should not claim a version it is not — but setting `ipn_version: "1.98.9"` clears the gate; bare semvers get the `version.Long()` hash suffix appended automatically so the console actually displays them (verified on the wire: `1.98.9` is sent as `1.98.9-t00000000000-g00000000000`). Documented in the README with a "Device is too old" troubleshooting note. Headscale users need none of this.
- **`netcheck_override`: let the device pick its DERP home region by measured latency.** The node reports a home relay to the control plane — the region every peer dials when it can't reach the device directly — and until now that was always whatever the control plane echoed back, with a compile-time fallback of region 4 (Frankfurt). A device far from that region relays every connection across a continent (measured on a board in Australia: ~700–900 ms to Frankfurt versus ~50 ms to Sydney, and an OTA over the relay taking 498 s instead of 26 s). The measurement code existed but had no way to reach it: `netcheck_override_enabled` was never set by the component, so it was permanently off. It is now a YAML option (`netcheck_override`, default `false`, with `netcheck_override_threshold` defaulting to `50ms` to prevent flapping between near-identical regions), documented under *Picking the DERP region*. Default-off is deliberate: a home-region change must be announced to every peer before it takes effect, so it is disruptive, and a device near the default region gains nothing.

### Fixed
- **A refused registration now says why, and healthy nodes stop being told they're broken** ([#38](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/pull/38), by [@timmills](https://github.com/timmills)). The startup check looked at `User.ID` and `User.DisplayName`, neither of which indicates health: `DisplayName` is documented as an override (empty is normal), and auth-key or tag-owned nodes legitimately have no bound user — so perfectly healthy devices logged a red "the control plane didn't bind us to a real user" on every boot, recommending a factory reset that would not have helped. Meanwhile the fields the reference client actually acts on (`Error`, `NodeKeyExpired`, `AuthURL`) were never read, so a genuinely refused registration said nothing and surfaced later as a confusing "node not found". The component now reports the control plane's own error text, treats an expired node key and a pending authorization URL explicitly, and takes the identity only for display. Verified on hardware in both directions — a deliberately malformed key now yields `RegisterResponse.Error: … failed to parse auth-key: key too short, expected at least 77 chars after prefix, got 53` instead of a misleading identity warning.
- **Log flood under a DISCO storm no longer starves the watchdog.** When an aggressive peer keeps probing (or the device's own probe table saturates), the per-event `DISCO PONG unmatched` / `DISCO probe table full` warnings fired many times a second — and on a constrained device the logging itself contributed to task-watchdog starvation and reboot loops (field-reproduced on the bench: the node died within minutes whenever one busy peer targeted it, and the fast reboot even triggered an OTA rollback to the previous firmware when it hit before app-verify). Both warnings are now rate-limited to one line per 10 s with a suppressed-event count (log-throttle pattern adopted from [@timmills](https://github.com/timmills)' work in [#36](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/pull/36)), and the per-packet chatter on the hot path (`PONG sent`, `DERP TX: SendPacket`, `Probe registered`) moved from INFO to DEBUG, so it only costs anything with the debug-log switch on. This measurably extends survival under sustained extreme fire and removes the log-driven part of the starvation; a residual stall in the status path under the same extreme conditions is identified and tracked separately.
- **Large tailnets: netmap updates spanning multiple HTTP/2 frames are no longer corrupted or silently lost** ([#35](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/pull/35), by [@timmills](https://github.com/timmills)). A MapResponse large enough to span DATA frames (or arrive split across socket reads — routine, since compression is disabled) desynchronised the long-poll reader: frames split across reads were dropped, only the last DATA frame in a read was kept, and the initial netmap's trailing bytes were discarded — producing deterministic `implausible message size` errors and silently lost peer updates on tailnets past a few dozen nodes. The long-poll reader now reassembles HTTP/2 frames across reads, accumulates every stream-5 DATA frame, and both map paths share one length-prefixed (4-byte little-endian, per the reference client) framed stream. The series also fixes six defects found reviewing it against the reference: a one-byte out-of-bounds write, bytes lost when a read ended mid-frame-header, unbounded frame lengths stalling the reader, reassembly state surviving reconnects, an oversized-frame guard that re-injected rejected bytes, and a completion detector that probed both endiannesses. Verified on hardware with a 53-node netmap (43.5 KB across 14 Noise frames, byte-exact). Follow-up hardening: an implausible length prefix now drops the session and reconnects instead of discarding the buffer — once the framed stream is out of sync there is no recovery within the session, and discarding alone left the node wedged with every liveness signal green.

## [0.5.5] — 2026-08-06

### Fixed
- **A failed DERP relay connection now recovers instead of staying dead for the rest of the boot** ([#33](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/33)). Both the connect and reconnect paths gave up after 3 attempts, and nothing ever re-armed them while the control plane sat healthy in its long-poll — a ~10 s transient at the wrong moment killed the relay path permanently while `VPN Connected` stayed true. The relay task now retries indefinitely on exponential backoff (5 s doubling to a 60 s cap, mirroring the control-plane reconnect policy), and a new RX-liveness watchdog reconnects when a "connected" relay has been silent for 90 s (DERP servers keepalive every ~15–60 s), instead of trusting a liveness stamp the task refreshed itself. Fixing the retry exposed a second, worse bug on the same path: every failed connect attempt leaked the full TLS state (~17 KB), so repeated failures exhausted the heap until every later TLS handshake died instantly (`SSL - Bad input parameters`) — retrying forever would have been useless without also fixing this; all failure paths now tear down the TLS context completely.
- **Self-hosted Headscale with embedded DERP: the relay now actually connects.** When the device's home DERP region isn't present in the tailnet's DERPMap (typical on Headscale, which serves only its embedded region), the component dialed a hardcoded public Tailscale relay that none of the tailnet's peers use. It now picks the first usable region from the tailnet's own DERPMap and makes it home.
- **ACL revocation (and any other silent peer omission) now reaches the device** (reported in [#32](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/32)). Peers were only ever dropped on an explicit `PeersRemoved`, but the control plane expresses ACL revocation by simply omitting the peer from the next full netmap — so revoked peers were probed and handshaked forever, and the NVS fast-boot cache resurrected them (and even peers from a *previous control plane*) at every reboot. A full `Peers` list is now treated as authoritative: table entries absent from it are removed, and removals also drop the peer's NVS cache entry so it stays gone across reboots.

### Changed
- `DISCO decrypt failed` now names the claimed sender (peer hostname when the disco key is known, `unknown peer` + key prefix otherwise) and the path it arrived on (DERP/direct), so the failure can be attributed to a specific peer ([#31](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/31)).

## [0.5.4] — 2026-07-29

### Fixed
- **The device now detects and recovers from a silently dead control-plane session** ([#32](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/32)). The control plane's front end can keep the HTTP/2 connection perfectly healthy (our keepalive PINGs keep being answered) while the server-side map session is already gone: the admin console shows the node *offline*, netmap updates stop, and new peers can't reach the device — while `VPN Connected` stays true and existing tunnels keep working, so nothing noticed. A new stream-liveness watchdog tracks actual map-stream traffic (real `MapResponse`s and the control plane's ~60 s keepalives, not transport chatter): after 5 minutes of stream silence the component logs `Control-plane map stream silent … reconnecting` and drives the normal reconnect path (~40 s full re-register). Verified live: a simulated dead map session behind a healthy TLS front end was detected at exactly 300 s and the device recovered by itself ~20 s after the control plane returned; `VPN Connect Count` increments on each such recovery, so automations can observe it.

## [0.5.3] — 2026-07-16

### Fixed
- **Builds again on ESPHome 2026.7.** 2026.7 reworked the ESP-IDF build generation and stopped routing component options through `platformio.ini` — the mechanism the component used to wire in the vendored `microlink` library (a generated `patch_cmake.py` registered via `extra_scripts`, plus `-I` include flags) silently no longer ran, so the build failed with `fatal error: microlink.h: No such file or directory` ([#28](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/28)). microlink (and its nested `wireguard_lwip`) are now registered through ESPHome's official `add_idf_component()` (local `path`), which works the same on 2026.6.x and 2026.7. Verified building clean on both.

## [0.5.2] — 2026-07-16

### Fixed
- **`max_peers` above 16 silently left peers unreachable over TCP.** The YAML option accepted 1–64 and sized microlink's peer table accordingly, but the WireGuard peer table underneath was hardcoded to 16 — peers 17+ got discovery (Tailscale `ping` answered!) but never a WireGuard session, so every TCP connection to/from them timed out; which 16 peers won was MapResponse arrival-order lottery, reshuffled per boot. The WireGuard table is now sized from the same `max_peers` value (each slot costs ~0.9 KB). Found investigating [#27](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/27); the probable cause of [#20](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/20). The `Peer limit FULL` warning now reflects the real ceiling too.
- **NVS-cached peers were not registered into WireGuard at boot.** The fast-boot peer cache pre-loads peers before the WireGuard interface exists (`wg_peer_index = -1`) and nothing re-registered them afterwards — until a full netmap happened to re-deliver a peer it stayed DISCO-visible but WireGuard-dead. A reconciliation pass now registers all cached peers right after the interface comes up.
- **Headscale ≥ 0.26: all inbound TCP was dropped (v0.5.0 regression).** On the streamed-netmap path the WireGuard interface was brought up before the VPN IP was known, leaving the netif on a temporary address forever — inbound packets to the real tailnet IP were silently discarded while outbound traffic, DISCO and the control plane all kept working. Registration is now signalled only after the initial netmap is read, and the netif address self-heals every 10 s if the control plane ever re-assigns the IP.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-07-06

### Fixed
- **Compile error with the `tailscale-core` package (or any config without a `switch:`).** `tailscale.h` referenced `switch_::Switch` in the `set_debug_log_switch` setter (and `setup()` read the debug-log switch) without the `#ifdef USE_SWITCH` guard, so builds that include no switch platform at all failed with `'switch_' has not been declared` ([#26](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/26)). Both sites are now guarded; entity-less builds compile again.

### Documentation
- **Troubleshooting:** added the `Found multiple SNTP configurations but id is inconsistent` entry — the package ships its own SNTP (`id: tailscale_time`); extend it with `id: !extend tailscale_time` instead of declaring a second SNTP block ([#26](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/26)).

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-02

### Added
- **`login_server` now accepts `https://` URLs** — Headscale (or any Tailscale-compatible coordinator) behind TLS works, including reverse-proxy setups that force HTTPS with a 308 redirect ([#23](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/23)). The control-plane connection (`/key` fetch, Noise upgrade, register, long-poll) runs inside an `esp_tls` session validated against the ESP-IDF public-CA certificate bundle, so Let's Encrypt and other public-CA certs work out of the box; **self-signed / private-CA certs are not supported yet**. Based on [@jonny190](https://github.com/jonny190)'s work in [#18](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/pull/18), re-ported onto the current vendored microlink line with fixes (deterministic `errno` mapping for the TLS read path, TLS-buffer peek before `select()`, scheme-flag reset in URL parsing).

- **Material Design icons on every default-package entity.** Each entity in `packages/tailscale/tailscale.yaml` now ships a sensible `icon:` (e.g. `mdi:shield-check` for VPN Connected, `mdi:account-network` for Peers Online, `mdi:calendar-clock` for Node Key Expiry), so the Tailscale entities show meaningful glyphs in Home Assistant out of the box. Inspired by [@sorrypqa](https://github.com/sorrypqa)'s fork. Not a breaking change — the entity `name`/`id`/`unique_id` are unchanged, and you can still override any icon in HA per entity.

### Fixed
- **Works with the current Headscale (≥ 0.26) map protocol.** Newer Headscale answers the classic non-streaming netmap fetch with an empty body — the netmap is only delivered on the streaming long-poll. The component now detects the empty answer instantly (no 60-second stall and no misleading "check auth_key" hint) and reads the initial netmap — VPN IP, peers and the DERP map — from the stream instead of failing with `Empty MapResponse` and reconnect-looping. Verified live against Headscale 0.28. Tailscale SaaS behaviour is unchanged.
- **Custom control-plane (Headscale) support regressed in 0.3.0 — restored.** The 0.3.0 vendored-library resync silently dropped both the `login_server` URL parsing (scheme/port were handed raw to the DNS resolver and the port was hardcoded to 80 — the "DNS error" in [#23](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/23)) and the Noise server-key fetch (`GET /key?v=88`), without which every Headscale handshake failed against the baked-in Tailscale SaaS key. Versions 0.3.0–0.4.2 could therefore only connect to Tailscale SaaS; `host`, `host:port`, `http://…` and (new) `https://…` login servers all work again.

### Documentation
- **Troubleshooting:** added an entry explaining that PSRAM is a hard requirement and that forcing the PSRAM check off (as a few forks do by hardcoding the detected size to `0`) does **not** enable a working no-PSRAM mode — that small-buffer path was never implemented, so it only stops the device from connecting ([#9](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/9)).

## [0.4.2] — 2026-06-03

### Changed
- **Telemetry device id now carries a 2-character integrity check.** The on-the-wire id is 18 hex chars: the same one-way 16-hex anonymous id plus a 2-hex check (`SHA-256(salt + id)[0]`). The receiving Worker recomputes the check from the id and drops random/garbage posts — cheap anti-abuse friction, not authentication. **Backward compatible:** firmware ≤ 0.4.1 (bare 16-hex id, no check) is still accepted through **2026-08-31 UTC**; from 2026-09-01 only the 18-hex form is accepted, so update before then. The stored anonymous id is unchanged (still the 16-hex hash) — no new data is collected (`components/tailscale/telemetry.{h,cpp}`, `telemetry/worker.js`).
- **Telemetry status now logs through the standard ESPHome logger** instead of raw ESP-IDF logging (which was invisible at default log levels) — init and send results now show under the `tailscale.telemetry` tag.

### Backend (telemetry Worker — no device firmware change required)
- Replaced the per-source-IP rate limit with an **accept-always policy plus a per-device storage cap** (the most recent ~200 events per device are kept; older rows age out). A crash-looping device's boot reports — exactly the signal worth seeing — are never dropped, while no single device can grow the database unbounded.
- Added a **`device_versions` rollup** (one row per device+version with first/last-seen and a count, never pruned) so each device's version-upgrade timeline survives the per-device events cap.
- **`/v1/stats` is now behind the same HTTP Basic admin auth as `/admin`** (it was previously publicly readable).
- Worker responses now send `cache-control: no-store` so the Cloudflare edge no longer serves stale cached telemetry responses.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-06-03

### Changed
- **Telemetry admin dashboard:** the Recent activity and Top devices tables now have client-side per-column filters, click-a-header sorting, and a row-limit selector (50–1000) with a "showing X of Y" counter (`telemetry/worker.js`). Backend/admin only — **no device firmware change** from 0.4.0.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-03

### Added
- **Anonymous telemetry (on by default; one YAML line to opt out).** On boot, then roughly once a day, the component POSTs a small anonymous JSON event to a Cloudflare Worker over HTTPS. The entire payload: an anonymous device id (`SHA-256(WiFi MAC + salt)[0..7]`, one-way), component version, event type, chip model, uptime, boot count, reset reason, PSRAM-present flag, and tailnet-connected flag — never the MAC, SSID, IP, tailnet name, peers, or auth key. The device sends no IP; the Worker stores only coarse geo (country/region from the Cloudflare edge), never the IP. Turn it off with `disable_telemetry: true`. Implementation: `components/tailscale/telemetry.{h,cpp}`; backend: `telemetry/worker.js`. See the [Telemetry](README.md#telemetry) section.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-03

### Breaking
- **PSRAM is now a hard requirement.** Boards without PSRAM never actually worked — the HTTP/2 + JSON control-plane buffers are a fixed 512 KB each and cannot be allocated from internal RAM, so a no-PSRAM board never fetches the tailnet map and never connects ([#9](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/9)) — but earlier docs wrongly implied a small-buffer no-PSRAM fallback. If your board has no PSRAM it will not connect; the boot log now says so explicitly (`ESP_LOGE`). The large microlink update in this release also changes memory/timing behaviour, so **re-verify after updating** and pin `packages:` to a tag rather than `ref: main` if you need stability.

### Changed
- **Updated the vendored microlink library to the consolidated dev line (`058b374`).** Large upstream jump that brings the DERP / WireGuard work which previously lived only on feature branches:
  - DERP relay client split into concurrent reader + writer tasks, and the exit-node throughput collapse eliminated (TLS-write backpressure no longer forces a reconnect; `TCP_NODELAY` + frame coalescing; fixed the non-blocking-socket I/O hot-spin that starved other tasks).
  - WireGuard DERP fallback is now gated on the WG data plane (`wireguardif_peer_is_up()`) instead of the DISCO has-direct-path latch — fixes the after-roam/reboot wedge where a peer with live DISCO pongs but no completed WG handshake was never relayed.
  - control-plane + DERP sockets pinned to the upstream STA netif so they don't blackhole when an exit node flips `netif_default` to the tunnel.
  - new netcheck module (DERP-region RTT measurement) plus assorted WG/heap/stability fixes and a coord/DERP teardown use-after-free fix.
  - Validated end-to-end on ESP32-S3 (8 MB octal PSRAM) via the HA ESPHome builder: clean build, OTA, HA API handshake over Tailscale, full peer list, DERP connected, stable.
- microlink's bundled x25519 is namespaced to `ml_x25519` so it no longer clashes with wireguard_lwip's identical `x25519` in the vendored build (object-file/symbol de-duplication; no functional change).
- The "No PSRAM detected" boot log is now an honest `ESP_LOGE` stating the device will not connect without PSRAM (was a misleading "using small buffers (max ~30 peers)" warning).

### Documentation
- **PSRAM is now documented as required, not "recommended".** The previous docs claimed the component falls back to small buffers and works without PSRAM (~30 peers) — that small-buffer mode was never actually implemented: the HTTP/2 + JSON control-plane buffers are a fixed 512 KB each and cannot be allocated from internal RAM, so a no-PSRAM board fails to fetch the tailnet map and never connects (this is [#9](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/9)). README and the `Device Memory` "Internal RAM" description updated to state PSRAM is a hard requirement.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Ethernet support.** The `tailscale:` component no longer hard-requires `wifi:` — it now depends on the generic ESPHome `network` layer, so it works on Ethernet-equipped ESP32 boards (e.g. Waveshare ESP32-S3-ETH / W5500). A `wifi:` **or** an `ethernet:` block is still required; a config with neither is rejected at validation with a clear message. Contributed by @DylanSallee ([#22](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/pull/22), closes [#21](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/21)).

## [0.2.1] — 2026-05-19

### Added
- Stable `tailscale_*` IDs on every entity in the default `packages/tailscale/tailscale.yaml` so they can be referenced from lambdas, `on_*` triggers, and conditions inside ESPHome ([#17](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/17)). HA-side `entity_id`s, `unique_id`s, and the web_server URLs are unchanged (derived from each entity's `name:`, not `id:`), so this is **not** a breaking change — existing HA history and automations keep working.

### Documentation
- FAQ entry clarifying the ESP is not a subnet router / connector / TCP forwarder ([#16](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/16))
- Entity Reference note pointing out the `tailscale_*` IDs and how to use them in lambdas / `on_*` triggers ([#17](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/17))

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-03

### Added

- **Minimal-install package variant: `tailscale-core.yaml`.** New
  alternative import file that loads the Tailscale component, its
  ESP-IDF lwIP tweaks, the NTP time source, and the logger baud rate
  — but does NOT auto-register any of the diagnostic entities
  (binary_sensor, text_sensor, sensor, switch, text, button). The
  user then declares only the entities they want. Requested in
  [#14](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/14) by
  @tybord, who wanted a clean device web UI focused on their own
  sensors and switches. The regular `tailscale.yaml` package still
  registers the full entity set as before — backward-compatible.

### Changed

- **Per-platform schema defaults removed (breaking for direct
  `external_components` users only).** The component's per-platform
  Python schemas (`binary_sensor.py`, `text_sensor.py`, `sensor.py`,
  `switch.py`, `text.py`, `button.py`) previously declared
  `cv.Optional("entity_name", default={"name": "..."})` for every
  Tailscale-platform entity, which silently auto-registered the
  full default entity set even when the user listed only a few.
  This blocked the per-entity opt-in that the new
  `tailscale-core.yaml` package needed. Defaults are now removed —
  every entity must be explicitly listed in the user YAML to be
  registered. **No effect on users who import `tailscale.yaml` via
  `packages:` — that package YAML still spells out every default
  entity verbatim, so behavior is unchanged.** Direct
  `external_components: source:` users who relied on the implicit
  defaults need to add the entities they want explicitly.

## [0.1.6] — 2026-04-29

### Added

- **Runtime PSRAM hint with concrete YAML config.** When the firmware
  boots and `esp_psram_get_size()` returns 0 on an ESP32-S3, it now
  emits a multi-line WARN log with a copy-pasteable `psram:` block for
  both common variants (`N8R8` / `N16R8` octal/80MHz and
  `N8R2` / `N16R2` quad/40MHz), explicitly noting that ESPHome's
  `psram:` block forces the configured mode. Users hitting the
  Dylan-style "PSRAM not detected even though it's there" case now
  get the fix from the serial log alone, without needing to read the
  Troubleshooting docs.
- **Tailscale tag now respects the debug-log level switch.**
  `esp_log_level_set("tailscale", level)` is now called alongside the
  microlink (`ml_*`) tags in `apply_debug_log()`. Previously the
  tailscale-tagged warnings (including "No PSRAM detected") were
  silently dropped because the tag stayed at the ESP-IDF default
  level. With this fix, WARN-level logs from this component
  propagate at default config and INFO when the debug switch is on.

### Documentation

- **Hardware compatibility: AI-Thinker ESP32-CAM added to verified
  boards.** Community-confirmed in
  [#15](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/15) by
  @gastonc on the 8 MB PSRAM revision of the AI-Thinker ESP32-CAM
  with `psram: mode: quad speed: 80MHz` (classic ESP32 has no octal
  PSRAM). Verified to run alongside the ESPHome `esp32_camera`
  component on the same device with 4 peers online over a direct
  Tailscale route — first non-S3 board with a confirmed-working
  setup, demonstrating RAM and task-scheduling headroom is sufficient
  on classic ESP32 once PSRAM is enabled.
- **Step #4 warning: don't use `web.esphome.io` for repeated flashes.**
  In response to
  [#13](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/13) by
  @TimDowker, the README now warns at the `use_address` pinning step
  that the browser-based ESPHome flasher erases the full flash on
  every write, which wipes the NVS partition where the Tailscale
  identity (machine_key + WireGuard keypair + disco keypair) lives.
  Each re-flash with `web.esphome.io` therefore registers as a
  brand-new node and gets a new `100.x` IP, breaking the just-pinned
  `use_address`. Recommended alternatives that preserve NVS: the
  ESPHome HA add-on, the ESPHome CLI (`esphome run`), or OTA from
  the dashboard once the first pinning has succeeded.
- **Tailnet lock: pre-signed auth key path documented as not-a-shortcut.**
  In response to
  [#12](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/12) by
  @TimDowker, the *Known limitations → Tailnet lock* section now
  explains why the `tailscale lock sign $AUTH_KEY` (pre-signed auth
  key) flow does not bypass the lock barrier on its own: the wrapped
  `tskey-auth-XXXXXXX--TL{...}` form carries a client-side crypto
  payload (a `SigCredential` + single-use Ed25519 private key) that
  the client must unwrap and use to Ed25519-sign its own node key
  before sending a full `NodeKeySignature` chain in `RegisterRequest`
  — the same crypto stack microlink does not implement (no Ed25519
  primitive, no NKS struct, no register-side field). Wire-format
  reference: [tailscale/tailscale#7431](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/pull/7431).
- **Fixed misleading advice in the PSRAM troubleshooting section.** The
  v0.1.3 entry told users "if unsure of variant, try `mode: quad
  speed: 40MHz` first because octal chips can run in quad mode at
  lower bandwidth" — that turned out to be **wrong** (verified during
  v0.1.4 testing). ESPHome's `psram:` block forces the configured
  mode and an octal chip configured for quad mode does NOT initialize
  PSRAM. Replaced with honest trial-and-error guidance: try
  `mode: octal speed: 80MHz` first (the most common variant on
  ESP32-S3 dev boards), and if PSRAM stays undetected switch to
  `mode: quad speed: 40MHz`. One of the two will work; the YAML
  block must match the chip variant exactly.

## [0.1.5] — 2026-04-26

### Reverted

- **Reverted v0.1.4's PSRAM-default-on change.** Post-publication
  testing showed that an explicit `psram: mode: quad speed: 40MHz`
  block does NOT work on octal-PSRAM hardware (`N8R8` / `N16R8`) —
  ESPHome's `psram:` component **forces the configured mode** rather
  than auto-detecting, so an octal chip configured for quad mode
  fails to initialize and `esp_psram_get_size()` returns 0
  (`Available: NO`, `Device Memory: Internal RAM`). The v0.1.4
  default would have broken the most common ESP32-S3 dev board
  (N16R8) for users who copied the example. `example.yaml` is back to
  a commented `psram:` hint that lists the matching block for each
  variant. The README "Why PSRAM?" and "Memory modes" sections are
  back to their v0.1.3 wording. The Troubleshooting entry that
  explains the per-variant `psram:` block (added in v0.1.3) remains
  the correct path: there is no universal default that works for
  both quad and octal chips.

  Lesson: ESPHome's `psram:` block is hardware-specific, not
  fallback-tolerant. Don't ship YAML defaults that lock to a single
  chip mode. **If you're already on v0.1.4 and your board worked,
  staying on v0.1.4 is fine** — this revert only matters for users
  copying the new example.

## [0.1.4] — 2026-04-26

### Changed

- **PSRAM is now enabled by default in the example YAMLs.**
  `example.yaml` and `example-dev.yaml` ship with an active `psram:`
  block instead of leaving it commented. `example.yaml` uses
  `mode: quad speed: 40MHz` — the safe combination that works on every
  ESP32-S3 PSRAM variant (Quad `N8R2`/`N16R2` chips run at native
  speed; Octal `N8R8`/`N16R8` chips run at reduced bandwidth, still
  ample for the Tailscale workload because the network is the
  bottleneck). `example-dev.yaml` uses `mode: octal speed: 80MHz` to
  match the maintainer's reference hardware. This eliminates the most
  common first-boot frustration where a PSRAM-equipped board reported
  `Device Memory: Internal RAM` because no `psram:` block was active
  and the board defaults didn't match the chip variant. Octal users
  who want maximum throughput should override to
  `mode: octal speed: 80MHz`.

### Documentation

- **README "Why PSRAM?" and "Memory modes" sections aligned with the
  new default.** Both now reflect that PSRAM mode is the path users
  land on when following the example YAML, with internal-RAM mode
  treated as an explicit opt-out for boards without PSRAM hardware
  or configurations where the user removed the `psram:` block. Cross
  link to the existing Troubleshooting entry for the
  detection-mismatch case.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-04-26

### Documentation

- **PSRAM detection troubleshooting** — Reported in
  [#9](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/9) by
  @Martian-Dylan3. When the user's board ships with quad PSRAM (e.g.
  `N8R2` / `N16R2`) instead of the more common octal variant
  (`N8R8` / `N16R8`), ESPHome's `psram:` component fails to initialize
  because the `esp32-s3-devkitc-1` board defaults assume octal/80MHz.
  The result is `Device Memory: Internal RAM` even though the board
  has PSRAM, the MapResponse buffers fall back to 64 KB internal-RAM
  allocations, and the VPN never connects. Documented as a
  Troubleshooting entry in the README plus a commented `psram:` hint
  in the example YAMLs, since we can't predict the user's hardware
  variant from the package side.

### Diagnostics

- **`do_fetch_peers` failure-path logging expanded.** Previously the
  outer `MapRequest failed, will retry` warning fired for any silent
  `return -1` inside `do_fetch_peers`, with no way to tell which step
  actually failed. Added WARN-level logs at the most informative exit
  points so user reports can distinguish: `noise_send` transport
  failure (with elapsed time since MapRequest start), `frame_buf` /
  `h2_recv` / `resp_buf` allocation failures (with `free_heap` and
  `largest_free_block` so the heap-fragmentation case is visible),
  and incomplete MapResponse after the recv loop exits (with iter
  count, last `noise_recv` return code, body bytes received vs
  expected, and a 32-byte hex dump of the H2 buffer to identify
  `RST_STREAM`, `GOAWAY`, etc.).

## [0.1.2] — 2026-04-24

### Documentation

- **Tailnet lock is not supported** — reported in
  [#10](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/10) by
  @TimDowker. Added a "Known limitations" section to the README that
  spells out the gap: the upstream microlink library this component
  wraps does not implement the client side of tailnet lock — no
  `NodeKeySignature` field in `/machine/register`, no Ed25519 verifier
  in the crypto stack, no NKS validation when parsing
  `MapResponse`. Neither the "Sign machine" admin-panel flow nor the
  pre-signed auth key flow will work for an ESP32 node joining a
  locked tailnet. Workarounds documented: disable lock if it was
  enabled exploratorily, run embedded devices on a separate unlocked
  tailnet, or track the feature upstream on the microlink repo.

### Fixed

- **`max_peers` YAML option silently capped at 16** — reported in
  [#11](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/11). The
  option accepted values up to 64 at codegen time, but microlink's
  `ml_peer_t peers[ML_MAX_PEERS]` array is sized at compile time from
  the `CONFIG_ML_MAX_PEERS` Kconfig symbol (default 16), and
  `microlink_init()` clamped the runtime `config.max_peers` to that
  ceiling. Result: setting `max_peers: 64` in YAML produced a firmware
  that still capped peers at 16, with no warning. The Python codegen
  now propagates `max_peers` into `sdkconfig` via
  `add_idf_sdkconfig_option("CONFIG_ML_MAX_PEERS", ...)`, so the
  compiled ceiling matches the YAML value. Verified on ESP32-S3 with
  PSRAM: `max_peers: 32` → `VPN Peers Max` sensor reports `32` and
  `VPN Peer Status` flips from `Warning` (15/16) to `OK` (15/32).

## [0.1.1] — 2026-04-21

### Added

- **Automatic CGNAT self-heal** — merged
  [#8](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/pull/8) from
  @aviadra. When the device is behind carrier-grade NAT (phone
  hotspot, cellular, hotel WiFi), Tailscale's coordinator still
  advertises each peer's direct UDP endpoint but packets sent there
  are silently dropped. WireGuard's cached direct path then fails with
  `errno=113` (ESP-IDF lwIP surfaces `ERR_CONN` as errno 113, which is
  not always aliased to `EHOSTUNREACH` in newlib) until it eventually
  rotates to DERP on its own — tens of seconds to minutes of dead
  outbound traffic. `ml_tcp`'s retriable-errno set now includes literal
  113 and `ECONNABORTED`; when a connect fails with 113 and the WG
  output is not already pinned to DERP, the TCP layer flips
  `force_derp_output` on before the retry so the second attempt rides
  DERP and succeeds (~3 s total instead of tens of seconds). Home-WiFi
  paths are unaffected (first connect wins, branch never taken).

  Verified on ESP32-S3 hotspot cold boot: no `errno=113` storm, first
  outbound TCP connection lands via DERP on its first attempt.

### Changed

- **Named the WG `ERR_CONN` errno constant.** `ml_tcp.c` now defines
  `ML_ERRNO_WG_ERR_CONN` (value 113) and matches against it by name
  instead of the literal, with an inline comment explaining the
  ESP-IDF lwIP + wireguardif / newlib interaction so the magic number
  no longer needs re-deriving from commit archaeology.

### Documentation

- **HAOS Tailscale add-on userspace networking prerequisite** — merged
  [#7](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/pull/7) from
  @aviadra documenting that the Tailscale add-on must be switched out
  of userspace networking mode so other add-ons (ESPHome etc.) can
  reach tailnet peers. Includes a Quick Start callout, a Step 6 note
  about updating the ESPHome integration host address after switching
  from LAN IP to tailnet IP, and a Troubleshooting entry. Closes
  [#6](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/6).
- **Userspace networking follow-up** — added a disambiguation note
  between the new Troubleshooting entry and the existing "Userspace
  WireGuard" section (which is about the ESP's microlink stack, not
  the HA add-on checkbox), plus a short trade-off note on what is
  actually given up by disabling userspace mode on HAOS.
- **Mobile hotspots and CGNAT** — new README subsection under "Direct
  connections versus DERP relays" explaining the automatic
  `errno=113` self-heal: no configuration needed, ~3 s to first
  useful connection on hotspots, home WiFi unaffected.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-13

### Added

- **Runtime auth key override** — new `VPN Auth Key Override` text entity
  (password mode) lets you change the Tailscale auth key from HA without
  reflashing. Empty submit reverts to the YAML default. Key is persisted
  in NVS across reboots. New `VPN Auth Key Source` text sensor shows
  `Default (YAML)` or `Override (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)` with the timestamp.
- **VPN Auto-Rollback binary sensor** — shows whether turning off VPN would
  trigger the 60 s dead-man's-switch rollback (i.e. HA is connected via
  Tailscale).
- **Registration failure detection** — if the device fails to reach
  `CONNECTED` within 60 seconds of starting, the setup hint sensor shows
  an auth-source-aware message: either "Check your YAML auth key" or
  "Check your Override auth key" depending on which key is active.
- **Node key expiry date in setup hint** — when node key expiry is enabled,
  the hint now shows the actual deadline date (e.g. "Disable node key
  expiry … before: 2026-10-08 14:30") instead of a generic warning.
- **Headscale FAQ** — three new FAQ entries: self-hosted setup,
  Headscale key expiry differences, switching between control planes.
- **Consistent "Unknown" sensor states** — when VPN is disconnected, all
  dynamic text sensors, numeric sensors, HA route/IP sensors, and the key
  expiry warning binary sensor now show HA-native "Unknown" instead of blank
  or stale values. Static config values (Control Plane, Login Server, Peers
  Max) and lifetime counters (Connect Count) remain visible.
- **VPN switch OFF/ON reliability** — fixed use-after-free in microlink's
  zombie coord task that caused VPN to auto-reconnect ~18 s after switch OFF.
  Stop/destroy now runs on a background FreeRTOS task to avoid blocking
  loopTask and triggering WDT. Added atomic pointer guard (`s_active_ml`)
  in callbacks and sequencing gate (`s_stop_in_progress`) to prevent
  resource contention during OFF/ON cycles.
- **Pre-publish sensor clearing** — when HA is connected via Tailscale and
  VPN is turned off, sensor clear values are published before the tunnel
  dies (while API is still alive), so HA sees the state change.
- **HA API sensors accuracy** — HA API Connected, Connection Route, and
  Connection IP now correctly reflect real-time API state during VPN
  shutdown (detect Tailscale route and show disconnected).
### Removed

- **`example-dev-tailscale.yaml`** and **`example-dev-headscale.yaml`** —
  consolidated into `example-dev.yaml` (use the commented `login_server`
  line to switch between Tailscale SaaS and Headscale).

### Fixed

- **Debug log switch not restoring after reboot** — the VPN Debug Log
  switch state was correctly restored by ESPHome, but
  `TailscaleComponent::setup()` unconditionally reset the log level to
  OFF (priority 200 runs after the switch's priority 600 restore).
  Now reads the switch's already-restored state at setup time.
- **Microlink logs missing in package builds** — ESPHome defaults
  `CONFIG_LOG_MAXIMUM_LEVEL` to ERROR, which compiles out all ESP_LOGI/ESP_LOGW
  at the preprocessor level. The component now sets
  `CONFIG_LOG_MAXIMUM_LEVEL_INFO` automatically so the debug log switch works
  in all builds (including HA dashboard package installs), not just dev builds.
- **State-aware VPN Setup Hint** — when disconnected, the setup hint sensor now
  shows the current microlink state (Connecting, Registering, Reconnecting,
  Error) instead of a generic "Waiting for VPN..." message, giving users
  actionable feedback when auth_key is wrong or network is unreachable.
- **Reboot crash** — `microlink_stop()` is now skipped during
  `safe_reboot()`. Previously the stop path's FreeRTOS cleanup could
  race with the reboot sequence, triggering an idle-task WDT reset
  instead of a clean restart.
- **HA API Connection IP dedup** — when multiple HA API clients connect
  simultaneously, the sensor now shows only the unique IPs instead of
  duplicated entries.
- **Static sensors blank on boot** — `Peers Max`, `Memory Mode`,
  `Control Plane`, `Login Server`, and `Auth Key Source` are now
  published during `setup()` even when VPN is disconnected, so they
  never show as "Unknown" after a fresh boot.
- **Periodic sensor refresh when VPN disconnected** — a 10 s fallback
  publish cycle keeps static and cleared sensors up-to-date during
  extended disconnected periods.
- **Stop task timeout** — the background FreeRTOS stop task now has a
  timeout and rate-limited cleanup logging instead of potentially
  hanging indefinitely.
- **Node key expiry warning stuck Unknown** — after a reconnect,
  `invalidate_state()` cleared the `has_state` flag but kept the old
  boolean value. If the new value matched the pre-invalidation value,
  the publish was silently skipped. All four binary sensors now check
  `!has_state() || state != new_value` to guarantee re-publish.
- **Auth key empty submit** — submitting an empty value in the
  `VPN Auth Key Override` text entity now correctly reverts to the
  YAML default. Previously HA skipped the `control()` call because
  the published state was already empty; the entity now publishes
  `"********"` when a custom key is active.
- **VPN Uptime log spam** — publish frequency reduced from every 5 s
  to a delta threshold: 5 s for the first 5 minutes (responsive
  during startup), then 60 s thereafter.
- **VPN Auto-Rollback false positive on Local** — the rollback was
  incorrectly arming when HA was connected via LAN. Now only arms
  when `detect_ha_route_()` reports a Tailscale route.

### Changed

- **VPN Connect Count** — renamed from "VPN Connections" for clarity.
- **VPN Debug Log switch** — runtime-togglable switch (persisted across
  reboots via NVS) replaces the old `debug_log` YAML option. When OFF
  (default), all microlink INFO logs are suppressed to WARN for a quiet
  serial console; when ON, full diagnostic output is restored. Requires
  `CONFIG_LOG_TAG_LEVEL_IMPL_LINKED_LIST` sdkconfig (auto-set by the
  component).
- **WireGuard printf noise eliminated** — converted raw `printf("[WG_...")`
  calls in the WireGuard lwIP layer to `WG_DEBUG()` macro, which compiles
  to a no-op when `WG_DEBUG_LOGGING=0` (default).
- **Setup Hint URLs** — the VPN Setup Hint sensor now includes clickable
  GitHub README links: key expiry warning points to `#disable-key-expiry`,
  wifi use_address hint points to `#wifi-use-address`. Key expiry warning
  takes priority over the use_address hint.
- **Package YAML updated** — added all missing entities (HA API Connected,
  VPN Auto-Rollback, VPN Hostname, HA API Connection IP, VPN Control Plane,
  VPN Login Server, VPN Network, VPN Connect Count, VPN Debug Log switch)
  and fixed stale key names (`tailscale_enabled` → `vpn_enabled`,
  `tailscale_hostname` → `vpn_hostname`, `tailnet_name` → `network_name`).
- **Key Expiry → Node Key Expiry** — the `key_expiry` text sensor and
  `key_expiry_warning` binary sensor default names now include "Node" to
  clearly distinguish the per-device node key lifecycle from the one-time
  auth key. Entity IDs are unchanged.
- **Auth key entity naming** — the text input entity is now called
  `VPN Auth Key Override` (was `VPN Auth Key`) and its status sensor is
  `VPN Auth Key Source` (was `VPN Auth Key Status`). Override status
  shows `Override (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)` instead of `Custom (...)`.
- **Auth-source-aware failure hints** — the 60 s connection-failure
  hint now tells you which key to check (YAML default vs runtime
  override) and resets the reconnect phase so the next attempt starts
  clean.
- **Improved hint wording** — node key expiry hint shows the actual
  deadline date; wifi `use_address` hint uses clearer conditional
  phrasing ("If ESPHome is offline from builder…").
- **Package `refresh: 0s`** — the external_components block in the
  package YAML now bypasses GitHub's 24 h cache by default.
- **Scrubbed personal infrastructure details** — removed real LAN IP,
  Proxmox container reference, and local filesystem path from
  example-dev.yaml, CHANGELOG, and scripts.

- **Tailscale VPN on ESP32** as a drop-in ESPHome external component. The
  device joins your tailnet as a real Tailscale node — no subnet router,
  reverse proxy, or middleman. Built on the
  [microlink](https://github.com/CamM2325/microlink) protocol implementation.
- **Home Assistant entity surface** exposing the live state of the tunnel:
  - **Binary sensors:** `connected`, `key_expiry_warning`
  - **Text sensors:** `ip_address`, `hostname`, `memory_mode`, `setup_status`,
    `peer_status`, `magicdns`, `tailnet_name`, `key_expiry`,
    `ha_connection_route`, `ha_connection_ip`
  - **Numeric sensors:** `peers_online`, `peers_direct`, `peers_derp`,
    `peers_max`, `uptime`
  - **Buttons:** `reconnect` (multi-phase rebind → full restart → safe reboot)
  - **Switches:** `tailscale_enabled` (with 60 s dead-man's-switch rollback
    that restores the previous state if Home Assistant can no longer reach
    the device after the change)
- **Runtime PSRAM detection** — large buffers are enabled automatically when
  PSRAM is present, falling back to small buffers (~30 peers) otherwise.
- **Automatic `wifi: use_address` handling** — the component detects whether
  the configured address matches the actual Tailscale VPN IP at runtime and
  logs a hint if they diverge, so you don't have to hardcode it on first boot.
- **HA API connection route detection** — walks lwIP's TCP pcb table to show
  whether Home Assistant is reaching the device via LAN or via Tailscale, and
  exposes the HA-side IP as a separate sensor.
- **Reconnect state machine** with three escalating phases (rebind, full
  microlink restart, safe reboot) triggered by the `reconnect` button or
  automatic state transitions.
- **Peer capacity warnings** — periodic log lines warn when online peers
  approach or exceed `max_peers`.
- **Periodic diagnostic log summary** every 10 minutes: connection state,
  peer counts by type (direct vs DERP), heap, PSRAM, uptime.
- **SNTP time sync** included in the package so key-expiry timestamps render
  correctly in Home Assistant.
- **Headscale support via `login_server`** — the YAML option points the
  node at a custom control plane (Headscale, or any other Tailscale-
  compatible coordinator) instead of Tailscale SaaS. Empty keeps the
  default. The value may be a bare hostname, an IP, `host:port`, or a
  full `http://host[:port]` URL; `https://` is rejected. The setter
  reaches microlink via a new public `ctrl_host` field on
  `microlink_config_t` (vendored microlink fork change); config-
  supplied values take priority over the NVS-persisted override
  microlink already supported. Authentication, node registration, and
  the streaming MapResponse long-poll against a Headscale 0.23.0 instance
  are verified end-to-end (see *Confirmed working* below). Tailscale
  SaaS remains the default.
- **`contrib/headscale-test/`** — docker-compose harness, minimal
  `config.yaml`, and step-by-step README for standing up a local
  Headscale instance against which the component's auth and register
  flow can be reproduced end-to-end. Not shipped via `packages:`.
- **Packages-based distribution** — end users can drop a one-line
  `packages:` import into their YAML (see `example.yaml`) instead of hand-
  wiring every entity.
- **`example.yaml`** — end-user reference config using the GitHub package.
- **`example-dev.yaml`** — self-contained development config that points at
  the local component checkout and inlines all entity definitions, for
  contributors iterating on the component itself.
- **Comprehensive README** with quick-start, entity reference, configuration
  table, hardware requirements, troubleshooting, how-it-works, credits,
  and a dedicated *Deployment Notes* section covering real-world lessons:
  subnet routers vs userspace WireGuard, auth-key vs node-key expiry, NAT
  traversal realities, the ESPHome package cache footgun, and hardware
  expectations.
- **Screenshots** throughout the README: Home Assistant dashboard, device
  page, auth-key dialog, key-expiry states, web flasher.
- **`SECURITY.md`** describing the vulnerability reporting process.
- **`LICENSE`** (MIT) with proper attribution for microlink, WireGuard,
  Tailscale, and X25519.
- **GitHub Actions workflows:**
  - `validate.yml` — ESPHome config validation on every push and PR.
  - `check-microlink-update.yml` — alerts when the vendored microlink copy
    falls behind its upstream release.
  - `codeql.yml` — GitHub CodeQL static analysis for the Python codegen layer.
- **Dependabot** configuration for automated dependency updates.

### Changed

- **⚠ Breaking — removed the `update_interval` config option.** The
  component is now fully event-driven: sensors publish only when the
  underlying state actually changes, driven by microlink callbacks,
  reconnect transitions, and switch changes. If you had `update_interval:`
  set under `tailscale:`, delete that line — it is now a schema error.
  Diagnostic log cadence (10 min) is now independent of any polling
  interval.
- **⚠ Breaking — auth-key sensors renamed to `key_*`.** The entities
  previously named `auth_key_*` now live under `key_*` (e.g.,
  `key_expiry`, `key_expiry_warning`). This matches the underlying
  Tailscale concept: what the sensor exposes is the *node key* lifecycle,
  not the original auth key. If you had automations referencing
  `sensor.*_auth_key_*`, update them to `sensor.*_key_*`.
- **⚠ Breaking — `Tailscale Peers Total` sensor removed.** It was
  redundant with `Tailscale Peers Online`. Remove any automations that
  referenced it.
- **⚠ Breaking — `Tailscale DERP` switch removed.** Toggling DERP at
  runtime never worked reliably and added confusing state. The reboot
  button added in the same commit provides a cleaner recovery path.
- The default **node-key lifetime is now 180 days** (previously 90 days)
  to match Tailscale's own default.
- **Event-driven sensor publishing** replaced the earlier 30 s polled
  force-publish behaviour. Prior iterations used polling to keep the
  web-server SSE stream alive, but the underlying state-change paths now
  cover every case, and the polling path was pure noise.
- **Thread safety reworked** for the microlink ↔ ESPHome boundary:
  shared state uses `std::atomic`, and all lwIP netif operations are
  wrapped in `LOCK_TCPIP_CORE`.
- `Setup Status` sensor renamed to `Setup Hint` to better reflect its
  purpose (a hint about how to configure `wifi: use_address`).
- The component now uses the
  [Csontikka/microlink](https://github.com/Csontikka/microlink) fork as
  its tracked upstream, vendored as a direct copy into the repo rather
  than a git submodule.
- `example.yaml` now pulls the component + entities via `packages:`
  from GitHub so the build output exactly matches what end users get.
- README badge renames, screenshots refreshed, key-expiry documentation
  rewritten to clarify the relationship between auth keys and node keys.
- Hardware guidance generalised from "ESP32-S3 only" to "ESP32 with a
  currently-tested-on-S3 note," with an explicit acknowledgment that
  only ESP32-S3 + PSRAM has been verified end-to-end.

### Fixed

- **`web_server` + microlink ringbuf assert resolved.** Enabling
  ESPHome's `web_server:` block would reliably crash the device at
  ~50 s uptime with
  `assert failed: prvSendItemDoneNoSplit ringbuf.c:367
  ((pxCurHeader->uxItemFlags & rbITEM_WRITTEN) == 0)`, hit from
  `xRingbufferSendComplete` → `TaskLogBuffer::send_message_thread_safe`
  → `Logger::log_vprintf_non_main_thread_` → `esp_log_va` on the
  `ml_derp_tx_task` path. Root cause: ESPHome's non-main-thread log
  buffer (TaskLogBuffer) races between microlink's high-rate
  `esp_log` calls from `ml_derp_tx_task` / `ml_wg_mgr` and the
  `/events` SSE subscriber that `web_server` adds to the log
  consumer list, corrupting the ringbuf item header. Workaround in
  `example-dev.yaml`: `logger: task_log_buffer_size: 0` disables
  TaskLogBuffer entirely so `esp_log` routes straight to UART. The
  trade-off is that non-main-thread logs no longer reach the HA API
  `/events` stream or the web_server `/events` stream — UART
  (921 600 baud) remains the source of truth for microlink diagnostics.
  Verified 372 s clean with full WireGuard traffic + `web_server: port: 80`
  + 37 tailnet peers. The underlying TaskLogBuffer ringbuf race is an
  ESPHome-core issue and deserves an upstream report separately.
- **~40 s boot-time crash storm resolved.** Under stock settings the
  device would reliably reboot between ~35-45 s uptime with one of
  three symptoms: `task_wdt: loopTask (CPU 1)` watchdog reset,
  `sys_mutex_unlock: failed to give the mutex sys_arch.c:79` from the
  Logger → API log-forward path, or
  `assert failed: lwip_netconn_do_writemore api_msg.c:1738 (offset <
  len)` from `sent_tcp` on the tcpip_thread. Root cause: ESPHome's
  logger calls `uart_write_bytes` on the ESP-IDF UART driver, which
  is installed with `tx_buffer_size=0` and therefore blocks the
  calling task on the hardware-FIFO semaphore whenever the FIFO is
  full. At the default 115 200 baud (~11.5 KB/s) the microlink
  INFO-level log bursts around peer setup / initial MapResponse
  saturate the FIFO, `loopTask` stalls inside `uart_write_bytes`
  for multiple seconds, and the watchdog fires. With
  `LWIP_TCPIP_CORE_LOCKING=y` the stalled `loopTask` was also
  holding the lwIP core lock during the stall, which in turn
  exposed a latent race between `lwip_netconn_do_write`'s
  partial-write UNLOCK/sem_wait/LOCK dance (api_msg.c:1913-1919)
  and the `sent_tcp` callback re-entering `do_writemore` on
  tcpip_thread — the `api_msg.c:1738` assert and the stray mutex
  give failures. The fix has four parts, all in `example-dev.yaml`
  (and any user YAML targeting the same profile) plus one
  microlink change:
  - `logger: baud_rate: 921600` — eight times the throughput of
    the 115 200 default so `uart_write_bytes` drains the FIFO fast
    enough to never block under realistic log volume.
  - `sdkconfig_options: CONFIG_LWIP_TCPIP_CORE_LOCKING: n` — switch
    lwIP from core-locking to the mbox-based api message path so
    the partial-write race window cannot re-appear even if
    `loopTask` stalls briefly for any reason.
  - `sdkconfig_options: CONFIG_LWIP_TCPIP_TASK_STACK_SIZE: "6144"`
    — raise tcpip_thread's stack above the ESP-IDF default 3 072
    so API log-streaming and WireGuard callbacks have headroom
    and cannot silently corrupt adjacent heap objects.
  - `ml_udp.c:201`: `ml_udp_rx` priority lowered from
    `configMAX_PRIORITIES - 2` (23 on a stock build) to `5`. At
    priority 23 pinned to CPU 1 the task could preempt ESPHome's
    priority-1 `loopTask` on the same core; at priority 5 it
    sits in the same tier as other microlink worker tasks and
    can no longer starve the main loop. Not strictly required
    after the baud-rate fix but removes an entire future
    starvation class.
  Verification: 179 s continuous INFO-level stability run against
  the Tailscale SaaS control plane (`controlplane.tailscale.com`)
  with full microlink WireGuard traffic — zero reboots, zero
  asserts, zero `task_wdt` hits. The fix is on the logger UART
  path so it is control-plane-independent; a Headscale endurance
  re-run under the same profile is pending.
- **Headscale initial peer fetch works against non-streaming `serve()`.**
  Headscale v0.28's non-streaming `serve()` path does not write a
  `MapResponse` body for `OmitPeers=false`, so the old two-phase
  `MapRequest` flow (a `Stream=false` peer fetch on stream 3 followed
  by a `Stream=true` long-poll on stream 5) silently hung on stream 3
  and never populated peers. `do_fetch_peers` now sends a single
  `Stream=true` `MapRequest` on stream 5 and reads the initial
  `MapResponse` as the first length-prefixed chunk of the long-poll
  body. The parser was rewritten to use the deterministic 4-byte
  little-endian length prefix instead of the old "scan the first few
  bytes for `{`" heuristic, and to track `h2_parsed` incrementally
  so each Noise frame is parsed once. `do_start_long_poll` is gone —
  the single long-poll is the same connection the initial fetch used.
- **Bulk peer ingest no longer starves IDLE.** On first `MapResponse`
  with ~14 peers, `process_peer_updates` used to drain the entire
  queue in a tight loop. Each `ML_PEER_ADD` does a synchronous NVS
  flash write (~200 ms with NVS cache disabled) plus WireGuard peer
  setup plus a NaCl `box_beforenm` x25519 scalar-mult, so draining
  14 peers back-to-back blocked the `ml_wg_mgr` task for ~3 s and
  tripped `task_wdt` against the IDLE task on its core. Fix: the
  dispatcher now processes **at most one `ML_PEER_ADD` per call**
  and returns so the outer loop's `vTaskDelay(10)` yields. Cheap
  ops (`REMOVE`, `UPDATE_ENDPOINT`) still drain fully per tick.
- **`ml_wg_mgr` moved to CPU 0.** Previously pinned to CPU 1, which
  is also where ESPHome's `loopTask` runs. The WireGuard handshake
  init path calls `x25519` scalar-mult twice (~500 ms each on refc),
  and peer init calls it once more; concentrating all of that on
  CPU 1 starved `loopTask` long enough to trip `task_wdt` on the
  initial MapResponse burst. Moving `ml_wg_mgr` to CPU 0 leaves
  `loopTask` alone on CPU 1.
- **DISCO ping/pong encryption cost reduced ~500 ms → sub-ms.**
  `add_peer` now precomputes the per-peer NaCl `box_beforenm`
  shared secret once at peer-add time and caches it on the peer
  struct. Subsequent `disco_build_ping`, `disco_build_pong`,
  `disco_send_call_me_maybe`, and `process_disco_packet` use
  `box_afternm`/`box_open_afternm`, skipping the x25519 scalar
  multiply on every DISCO packet. Large tailnets that used to
  stutter during periodic DISCO pings now run smoothly.
- **lwIP thread safety** — replaced `ip_input` with `tcpip_input` in the
  WireGuard data path and added `LOCK_TCPIP_CORE` around netif
  operations, eliminating a class of crashes under traffic.
- **Reply routing** — peer reply traffic now tracks per-peer source IPs
  instead of relying on a single `last_rx` fallback, which broke when
  multiple peers were talking to the device simultaneously.
- **`wifi: use_address` injection** — now emitted via `RawExpression`
  C++ code so the ESPHome codegen can safely override the WiFi
  component's configured address at the right point in the init order.
- **`web_server` SSE crashes** — publish sensors only on value change,
  raised `LWIP_MAX_SOCKETS` to 24 to avoid httpd accept errors under the
  additional SSE load.
- **Peers Max sensor** now uses `PEER_SCHEMA` with `accuracy_decimals=0`
  so Home Assistant renders it as an integer count.
- **DERP/Enable switches** — full microlink restart on toggle, switch UI
  rollback if the change fails, HA-API auto-confirm after 30 s if the
  device remained reachable.
- **HA route byte order** — corrected a little-endian / big-endian mixup
  in the HA connection detection logic.
- **Setup Status / Setup Hint** — compares the configured IP with the
  actual VPN IP, not a stale copy.
- **Node-key expiry detection** — values below a sane epoch baseline
  (`2020-01-01 UTC`) are treated as "expiry disabled" (the Tailscale
  control plane sends Go's zero time when an admin disables expiry for
  a node). The `key_expiry` text sensor renders as empty in that state
  so Home Assistant shows "unknown," which is the correct state for a
  timestamp that does not exist. Both "Unknown + OK" and "valid
  timestamp + Warning" are explicitly documented as correct pairs.
- **Auth key no longer logged in plaintext.** Previously the full
  Tailscale auth key was emitted at INFO level inside
  `start_microlink_()`, which meant it landed in the serial console,
  the HA log stream, and any remote log collector the user had wired
  up. The log line now masks the key to its first 12 characters plus
  ellipsis, which is enough to distinguish `tskey-auth-` from
  `tskey-client-` and similar variants during debugging without
  exposing the secret portion.
- **Headscale Noise handshake** — microlink now fetches the server's
  Noise static public key from the Tailscale-compatible `/key?v=88`
  HTTP endpoint at setup time and passes it into `ml_noise_init` as
  the remote static key, replacing the previous behavior of always
  using Tailscale SaaS's hardcoded pubkey. Applies only when
  `login_server` is set; the SaaS path is unchanged. Implemented in
  `microlink/components/microlink/src/ml_coord.c` as a new
  `fetch_server_pubkey()` helper that parses the JSON response,
  extracts the `publicKey` field, strips the `mkey:` prefix, and
  hex-decodes the 32 bytes into a per-instance buffer on
  `microlink_t`.
- **`login_server` URL parsing.** The microlink control-plane host is
  now parsed into host + port + HTTP-Host-header components instead
  of being passed verbatim. Accepts bare hostname, `host:port`,
  `http://host`, and `http://host:port`; the HTTP/1.1 `Host:` header
  and HTTP/2 `:authority` pseudo-header are constructed correctly
  (bare host for port 80, `host:port` otherwise). `https://` is
  rejected because TLS is not implemented in this path. Previously
  the TCP path was hardcoded to port 80 and `ctrl_host` was copied
  raw into the HTTP Host header, which Headscale rejected as
  `400 Bad Request: malformed Host header` for any URL-form value.

### Removed

- **`update_interval` config option** — replaced by the fully
  event-driven publish path (see the Breaking entry above).
- **`Tailscale Peers Total` sensor** — redundant with `Peers Online`.
- **`Tailscale DERP` switch** — runtime toggling was unreliable.
- **Dead `enable_stun` / `enable_disco` knobs** — microlink runs both
  unconditionally and has no way to disable them; the options never
  actually did anything.
- **`tailscale_ip` explicit config parameter** — replaced by runtime
  detection that reads the VPN IP directly from microlink and compares
  it against the WiFi component's `use_address`.
- **Stale "Headscale is not supported" disclaimers** throughout the
  README have been removed in favor of the new Headscale section
  that describes the verified end-to-end auth, register, and
  streaming long-poll paths.
- **SonarCloud integration** — workflow file, `sonar-project.properties`,
  README badges, and the `SONAR_TOKEN` repo secret. Replaced by GitHub's
  native CodeQL static analysis.
- **Stale scaffolding files** from early development: `.gitmodules`,
  `include_fix`, broken symlinks, leftover packages directory.
- **Real Tailscale IPs and tailnet names** scrubbed from tracked files,
  comments, and screenshots (git history was rewritten once to remove
  an earlier leak).

### Security

- **Tailscale auth key is no longer logged in plaintext** on boot
  (`tailscale.cpp:45-47` in earlier revisions). See the Fixed section
  for the full explanation of the fix. This is the reason the v0.1.0
  release is now safe to cut — the prior behavior was a real
  secret-leak path into every log surface the ESPHome runtime
  touches.
- Added `SECURITY.md` describing the vulnerability reporting channel.
- CodeQL static analysis now runs on every push via `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`.
- The CI `validate.yml` workflow now also runs a full `esphome compile`
  of `example.yaml` on every push and pull request, catching C++-level
  breakage in the component or the vendored microlink before it lands
  on `main` and reaches users via `packages: ref: main`. Prior CI only
  ran `esphome config`, which validated YAML schema but never invoked
  the toolchain.
- Git history was rewritten (and force-pushed once, with branch
  protection temporarily relaxed for that single push) to remove a
  previously committed tailnet name and an unmasked device-page
  screenshot. No secrets were in the leaked content, but the cleanup was
  done to keep the public repo free of personal identifiers.

### Known limitations

These are not bugs — they are the current boundaries of what has been
verified. Treat them as the honest answer to "can I rely on this for X?"

- **Only ESP32-S3 with PSRAM is verified end-to-end.** Other ESP32
  variants (classic ESP32, C3, C6, P4) may work via microlink, but are
  not tested by this project. If you try it on a different chip, please
  open an issue with your results.
- **Node-key auto-renewal at 180 days is not yet verified.** The
  component exposes the current expiry timestamp via the `key_expiry`
  sensor and warns via `key_expiry_warning`, but whether microlink
  renews the node key without a device reboot has not been confirmed in
  a long-running deployment. Plan to reflash / reboot the device at
  least once every 180 days until this is verified.
- **Subnet routes and exit-node functionality** are intentionally
  out of scope for this release. The ESP is a *node* on your tailnet,
  not a gateway.
- **No automated tests** beyond the ESPHome config validation CI. The
  component has been tested manually and in a live deployment.

### Confirmed working

- **OTA updates over the Tailscale IP** — flashing the device via its
  `100.x.x.x` tailnet address (while the LAN path is unavailable) has
  been verified end-to-end.
- **Headscale authentication, registration, and streaming long-poll.**
  Against a local Headscale 0.23.0 instance (see `contrib/headscale-test/`),
  the device completes the Noise IK handshake,
  registers via `/machine/register`, and the streaming `/machine/map`
  long-poll on HTTP/2 stream 5 stays open and delivers delta
  `MapResponse` chunks on every periodic endpoint update. Verified with
  both bare-IP (`login_server: "192.168.1.42"`) and URL
  (`login_server: "http://192.168.1.42:80"`) forms. `headscale nodes list`
  shows the node present with IP `100.64.0.1` and online.
