## Why

Home Assistant users often run their HA instance at home behind a NAT, but they want to reach remote sensors — a weekend cabin, a parent's house, a workshop — without poking holes in someone else's firewall.

The traditional answer is **subnet routers**: put a Tailscale node on the remote network and route the ESP's LAN IP through it. This works, but it:

- needs an always-on machine at the remote site,
- adds a hop,
- depends on subnet-routing ACLs,
- and turns simple "device lives in my tailnet" into "device lives behind a gateway I have to maintain".

**This component removes the middleman.** The ESP32 itself becomes a Tailscale node with its own `100.x.x.x` address, showing up in your `tailscale status` list like any laptop or phone. Home Assistant connects to it directly over the tailnet — LAN, mobile data, anywhere — with the same rock-solid `api:` + `ota:` + `web_server:` stack you already trust.

<!-- IMAGE: Simple architecture diagram. Left: Home (HA, phone) inside a "Tailnet" box with a cloud icon. Right: Remote site (ESP32 with the tailscale component) also inside the Tailnet box. Arrow "direct WireGuard (no subnet router)". Below: Tailscale control plane cloud. -->

## Features

- **Pure Tailscale node** — the ESP joins your tailnet directly, no subnet router needed on either side.
- **Works with official Tailscale and Headscale** — connects to Tailscale SaaS out of the box; set `login_server` to point at a self-hosted [Headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale) instance instead.
- **Home Assistant native** — exposes a full set of Home Assistant entities out of the box: connection status, VPN IP, hostname, peer counts, node key expiry, uptime, MagicDNS name, peer status, memory mode, HA connection route, runtime auth key override, reboot/reconnect buttons, enable switch.
- **HA API Connection Route sensor** — tells you *how* HA is currently reaching the device: `Tailscale Direct`, `Tailscale DERP`, or `Local`. Great for debugging connectivity.
- **Node key expiry sensor + warning** — surfaces the node key expiry timestamp from the Tailscale control plane plus a `problem` binary sensor that turns off the moment you click "Disable key expiry".
- **Runtime auth key override** — change the Tailscale auth key from HA without reflashing. Persisted in NVS across reboots.
- **PSRAM-backed** — the control-plane and WireGuard buffers live in PSRAM (**PSRAM is required**; supports large tailnets with 50+ peers).
- **Self-healing reconnect** — three-phase recovery (rebind → full restart → reboot) when the tailnet link goes stale.
- **Auto `use_address` hint** — tells you exactly which line to add to your YAML so HA finds the device over Tailscale after first boot.
- **Package-based install** — one `packages:` line in your YAML and all entities appear.

---

## Requirements

### Hardware

- An **ESP32** board with **PSRAM — required** (recommended: 8 MB Octal PSRAM). Without PSRAM the device cannot allocate the control-plane buffers and will not connect.
- **At least 4 MB flash** — enough for the bootloader plus two OTA slots of the ~1 MB firmware. 8 MB or more is only useful if you want to stack other large ESPHome components next to Tailscale.

> **Current testing target:** active development and flashing is being done on **ESP32-S3**. Other ESP32 variants (classic ESP32, ESP32-C3, ESP32-C6, ESP32-P4, …) may work through the upstream [microlink](https://github.com/CamM2325/microlink) library, but most are **not yet verified** by this project. If you get the component running on a non-S3 chip, please open an issue / PR so we can list it here.

Boards currently verified:

- **ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1** (8 MB PSRAM, 16 MB flash) — the reference / test board
- **ESP32-S3-N16R8**
- **AI-Thinker ESP32-CAM** (classic ESP32, 8 MB PSRAM revision) — community-confirmed in [#15](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/15) by @gastonc. Use `psram: mode: quad speed: 80MHz` (classic ESP32 has no octal PSRAM). Verified to run alongside the ESPHome `esp32_camera` component on the same device with 4 peers online over a direct Tailscale route — RAM and task scheduling fit comfortably with PSRAM enabled.

> **Why PSRAM?** The Tailscale control protocol and WireGuard crypto state together need more contiguous RAM than a stock ESP32 has. The control-plane (HTTP/2 + JSON MapResponse) buffers alone can't be allocated from internal RAM, so **without PSRAM the device fails to fetch the tailnet map and never connects** — PSRAM is a hard requirement, not an optimization.

### Software

- **ESPHome 2026.3.1** or newer
- **ESP-IDF framework** (not Arduino) — this is enforced automatically by the package
- **Network connectivity — WiFi *or* Ethernet.** The component needs a network, not WiFi specifically; a `wifi:` or an `ethernet:` block (e.g. W5500 / LAN8720 boards such as the Waveshare ESP32-S3-ETH) both work. A config with neither is rejected at validation.
- **Home Assistant** with the ESPHome integration enabled
- A **Tailscale account** (or a self-hosted [Headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale) instance)

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a Tailscale auth key

Log in to the [Tailscale admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys) and go to **Settings → Personal Settings → Keys**. Click **Generate auth key...**.

![Tailscale Keys Page](docs/images/tailscale-keys-page.png)

Then fill in the dialog:

![Tailscale Auth Key Creation](docs/images/tailscale-auth-key-create.png)

**Recommended settings:**

| Option | Value | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Description** | `esphome-<devicename>` | So you can identify it later |
| **Reusable** | ✅ On | Lets you re-flash without regenerating a key |
| **Ephemeral** | ❌ Off | Ephemeral nodes get garbage-collected when offline, bad for ESPs that sleep or reboot |
| **Pre-approved** | ✅ On *(if your tailnet uses device approval)* | So the ESP can join without a manual click |
| **Tags** | `tag:esphome` *(optional)* | Useful for ACL targeting |
| **Expiration** | 90 days *(max)* | Tailscale caps this — see **Disable key expiry** below to make the resulting node key permanent |

Copy the key (starts with `tskey-auth-...`) — you'll paste it into your ESPHome secrets in a moment.

<a id="disable-key-expiry"></a>

> ### 🔑 Auth key vs. node key — important
>
> Tailscale has **two** different kinds of key, and they're easy to confuse:
>
> - **Auth key** (`tskey-auth-...`) — a *one-time ticket* that lets a new device register itself with your tailnet. The ESP only uses this on its very first boot, to prove to the control plane "I'm allowed to join". **After the first successful registration the auth key is no longer needed for normal operation** — the device has received its own private **node key** and talks to the tailnet with that from then on. Tailscale still shows the auth key in the admin console with a 90-day max expiry, but this does **not** kick the device off the tailnet when it expires — it only stops *new* devices from being able to register with the same key.
> - **Node key** — the per-device long-term identity, generated and stored on the ESP itself (in NVS). This is the key that actually keeps the device authenticated on the tailnet. **This one *does* have its own expiry**, and by default Tailscale expires node keys after ~180 days, after which the device is kicked off the tailnet and needs to be re-authenticated (which means re-flashing or re-running the auth flow — ugly on an unattended sensor at a remote cabin).
>
> **What this means in practice:**
>
> 1. Generate an auth key, flash the ESP with it, let the device register.
> 2. **Then go to the Tailscale admin → Machines → your ESP → ⋯ → "Disable key expiry".** This tells Tailscale "this specific device's *node* key never expires". Now the ESP stays on the tailnet forever, regardless of whether the original auth key expires.
> 3. **Reboot the ESP** (press the Reboot button in HA or power-cycle it). The updated expiry status is only fetched from the control plane during a fresh login — a simple reconnect is not enough. After the reboot, the **VPN Node Key Expiry Warning** sensor should turn off and the **VPN Setup Hint** will switch from the key-expiry URL to the `use_address` hint.
> 4. After that, the auth key is basically discardable — if it expires, nothing happens to the already-registered device. You only need a new auth key if you want to flash *another* ESP, or re-register this one from scratch (e.g. after `esptool erase_flash`).
>
> If you skip step 2, everything will *look* fine for months, and then one day the device silently drops off the tailnet and you'll have no idea why. **Disable node key expiry. Always. For every ESP you flash.**

### 2. Install the component

Create a minimal ESPHome YAML:

```yaml
esphome:
  name: esp32-tailscale
  friendly_name: ESP32 Tailscale

esp32:
  board: esp32-s3-devkitc-1
  framework:
    type: esp-idf

packages:
  tailscale:
    url: https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale
    ref: main
    files: [packages/tailscale/tailscale.yaml]
    refresh: 0s

tailscale:
  auth_key: !secret tailscale_auth_key
  hostname: "esp32-tailscale"

wifi:
  ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
  password: !secret wifi_password

logger:
  level: DEBUG

api:

# Optional — only for the initial bring-up test.
# web_server exposes a tiny HTTP page at http://<device-ip>/ that shows
# the live state of all entities. Handy to verify "yes, Tailscale is up
# and I can reach the device over its 100.x.y.z address from my browser".
# Once Home Assistant is connected over the API, you don't need this —
# feel free to remove the block, it just uses flash and RAM for nothing.
web_server:
  port: 80

ota:
  platform: esphome
```

> [!TIP]
> **Want only a subset of the Tailscale entities on the device's web UI / in Home Assistant?** Swap the `files:` entry for the minimal variant — `files: [packages/tailscale/tailscale-core.yaml]` — which loads the component without auto-registering any entities. You then declare only the ones you want yourself (any combination of `binary_sensor`, `text_sensor`, `sensor`, `switch`, `text`, `button` blocks under `platform: tailscale`). Useful when you want a clean web UI focused on your own sensors and switches. See the header comment in [`packages/tailscale/tailscale-core.yaml`](packages/tailscale/tailscale-core.yaml) for a complete example.

> [!NOTE]
> **"Device is too old, please upgrade it" in the admin console?** Tailscale gates some
> device operations (e.g. reassigning a node's address) on the reported client version,
> which this component leaves empty by default. Set `ipn_version` to clear the gate:
>
> ```yaml
> tailscale:
>   auth_key: !secret tailscale_auth_key
>   ipn_version: "1.98.9"   # optional; omitted (default) = report no version
> ```
>
> Bump the value if the console later calls it too old. Headscale users do not need this.
> It is reported in `version.Long()` shape; a bare semver like `1.98.9` gets synthetic
> commit hashes appended automatically so the console displays it. Default-off because a
> public component should not claim a version it is not.

And add to your `secrets.yaml`:

```yaml
wifi_ssid: "YourWiFi"
wifi_password: "YourWiFiPassword"
tailscale_auth_key: "tskey-auth-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

### 3. First flash

The device isn't on the tailnet yet, so OTA can't reach it. You need to get the firmware onto the device at least once before Tailscale can take over. Pick whichever method is least painful for you — they all produce the same result.

#### Option A — ESPHome Web (recommended for most users)

No CLI, no USB driver hunts, no Python install. Just a Chrome/Edge browser tab.

1. In your ESPHome dashboard (or your local ESPHome install) **compile** the device YAML to produce a binary. From the HA ESPHome add-on this is the "Install → Manual download (modern format)" button.
2. Plug the ESP32 into a computer via USB.
3. Open [web.esphome.io](https://web.esphome.io/) in Chrome or Edge.
4. Click **Connect**, pick the serial port, then **Install** → upload the `.bin` file from step 1.
5. When it's done, click **Use device** → watch the live logs right in the browser.

![ESPHome Web Flasher](docs/images/esphome-web-flasher.png)
<!-- IMAGE: web.esphome.io page mid-upload, showing Connect / Install dialog. -->

> **Why this is nice:** zero toolchain on your local machine, works on Windows/macOS/Linux/Chromebook identically, and the web flasher is maintained by the ESPHome team directly.

#### Option B — Home Assistant ESPHome add-on (if your ESP is plugged into the HA host)

If you're running the ESPHome add-on inside Home Assistant *and* the ESP32 is physically plugged into your HA machine, you can flash it straight from the HA UI with no separate tools:

1. Open the **ESPHome dashboard** in HA (Settings → Add-ons → ESPHome → Open Web UI).
2. Click **New device** → **Continue** → paste your YAML, or create from template.
3. Click **Install** → **Plug into the computer running ESPHome Dashboard**.
4. Pick the serial device (e.g. `/dev/ttyUSB0`) and hit **Install**.

From the second flash onwards the dashboard switches automatically to OTA over the tailnet IP, so you don't need to keep the USB cable plugged in.

#### Option C — USB with the ESPHome CLI (what I use for development)

Classic, fully scriptable, and the fastest feedback loop if you're iterating on the YAML.

```bash
esphome run your-device.yaml --device /dev/ttyUSB0
```

On Windows the device usually comes up as `COM3`, `COM4`, etc. Use `--device COM3` accordingly.

#### What to look for on first boot

Whichever method you picked, once the firmware is running connect to the serial log (web flasher, HA dashboard logs, or `esphome logs your-device.yaml`) and you should see:

```
[I][tailscale]: Initializing Tailscale (MicroLink)...
[I][tailscale]: PSRAM detected: 8192 KB - using large buffers
[I][tailscale]: Waiting for WiFi before starting...
[I][wifi]: WiFi Connected!

[I][tailscale]: Connected! VPN IP: 100.xx.yy.zz

```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Home Assistant OS users: disable "Userspace networking" on the Tailscale add-on.**
>
> The Tailscale add-on defaults to **userspace networking mode**, which keeps the VPN tunnel isolated inside the Tailscale container. In this mode, other add-ons — including the **ESPHome add-on** — cannot reach any `100.x.x.x` Tailscale address. OTA uploads, log streaming, and the ESPHome dashboard will all fail to connect to your device.
>
> **Fix:** Go to **Settings → Add-ons → Tailscale → Configuration** and set **"Userspace networking"** to **OFF**, then **restart** the Tailscale add-on. This creates the Tailscale network interface on the host network stack, which is shared by all add-ons.
>
> This only applies to Home Assistant OS and Supervised installs using the Tailscale add-on. If you run Tailscale directly on the host or in a standalone Docker container, this does not affect you.

<a id="wifi-use-address"></a>

### 4. Pin `use_address` to the Tailscale IP

After the first successful connection, **copy the `100.x.y.z` IP** from the log and add it to your YAML:

```yaml
wifi:
  ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
  password: !secret wifi_password
  use_address: "100.xx.yy.zz"   # ← your Tailscale IP
```

> On an **Ethernet** board, put `use_address` under your `ethernet:` block instead of `wifi:` — the meaning is identical.

Re-flash once more (still USB if the device is in front of you; from here on OTA will work).

> [!WARNING]
> **Don't use `web.esphome.io` for repeated flashes.**
>
> The browser-based flasher erases the entire flash on every write, which wipes the NVS partition where the Tailscale identity (`machine_key` + WireGuard keypair + disco keypair) lives. Result: every re-flash registers as a brand-new node, gets a new `100.x` IP, and the `use_address` you just pinned points at the old (now orphaned) node. Use one of these instead — they preserve NVS across flashes:
>
> - **ESPHome add-on** in Home Assistant (the dashboard's USB / OTA buttons)
> - **ESPHome CLI** (`pip install esphome` → `esphome run config.yaml`)
> - **OTA** after this first successful pin — the dashboard/CLI auto-selects OTA once `use_address` resolves, so re-flashes go over Tailscale and never touch NVS

> **Why this matters:** ESPHome's API and OTA clients need a single address to talk to the device. By pointing `use_address` at the Tailscale `100.x` IP, both LAN-side and remote Home Assistant instances reach the device through the tailnet — no port forwarding, no mDNS trickery, and it survives the device moving between WiFi networks.

> [!TIP]
> **Deploying to a remote site?** A typical use case is building the device at home and then moving it somewhere else — a cabin, a parent's house, a workshop. Configure multiple WiFi networks so the ESP can connect at both locations:
>
> ```yaml
> wifi:
>   networks:
>     - ssid: !secret wifi_ssid_home
>       password: !secret wifi_password_home
>       priority: 2
>     - ssid: !secret wifi_ssid_remote
>       password: !secret wifi_password_remote
>       priority: 1
>   use_address: "100.xx.yy.zz"   # ← your Tailscale IP (same everywhere)
> ```
>
> The `use_address` is your Tailscale `100.x` IP — it **does not change** when the device moves between WiFi networks. Set it once, deploy anywhere. Home Assistant will reach the device through the tailnet regardless of which WiFi it's connected to.

### 5. Disable key expiry on the new node

By default Tailscale expires every node key after **180 days** (the tailnet-wide default; an admin can shorten it to anywhere between 1 and 180 days in **Settings → Device management → Device approval**). For an unattended ESP, you want the node key to be **permanent** — which is a per-device flag, not a tailnet setting.

1. Open the [Tailscale Machines page](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines).
2. Find the new `esp32-tailscale` entry.
3. Click the `⋯` menu → **Disable key expiry**.

![Tailscale Disable Key Expiry](docs/images/tailscale-disable-key-expiry.png)
<!-- IMAGE: Tailscale admin → Machines → row for the ESP32 → menu open, "Disable key expiry" highlighted. Also show the "Expires" column turning into "Disabled". -->

In Home Assistant you'll see the `VPN Node Key Expiry` timestamp sensor display as **Unknown** (because the timestamp no longer exists — that's the standard HA rendering for an empty `timestamp` sensor) and the `VPN Node Key Expiry Warning` binary sensor display as **OK** (the `problem` device class renders `off` as "OK" with a check icon). That `Unknown` + `OK` pair is the recommended steady state for an unattended node — nothing is missing, nothing is wrong, the key simply never expires.

| Disabled (recommended) | Enabled (needs attention) |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Key expiry OK](docs/images/ha-key-expiry-ok.png) | ![Key expiry Problem](docs/images/ha-key-expiry-problem.png) |
| `Unknown` + `OK` — key never expires, device stays on the tailnet indefinitely. | `In 6 months` + `Problem` — the node key will expire and the device will drop off the tailnet unless you click **Disable key expiry**. |

### 6. Add to Home Assistant

Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → ESPHome → Add Device** and enter the Tailscale IP (`100.xx.yy.zz`) from step 4. HA will discover the device and offer to add all entities.

![Home Assistant ESPHome Integration Add](docs/images/ha-integration-add.png)
<!-- IMAGE: HA ESPHome integration "add device" dialog with the 100.x IP typed in. -->

![Home Assistant Device Page](docs/images/ha-device-page.png)
<!-- IMAGE: The HA device page showing all the Tailscale entities in the sensor / switch / button cards. -->

> [!NOTE]
> **Already added the device via its LAN IP?** If you previously added the device to Home Assistant using its local network address (e.g. `192.168.x.x`), you need to update the ESPHome integration to use the Tailscale IP instead. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → ESPHome**, click **Configure** on the device entry, and change the host address to the `100.x.y.z` Tailscale IP. Otherwise HA will keep connecting over the LAN and fall back to "unavailable" when the device is not on the same network.

Done — the ESP is now a first-class citizen of your tailnet and your Home Assistant.

## Entity Reference

All entities are created automatically when you include the package.

Every default-package entity has a stable `tailscale_*` ESPHome `id` (e.g. `tailscale_connected`, `tailscale_ip_address`, `tailscale_peers_online`, `tailscale_vpn_enabled`), so you can reference them from lambdas, `on_*` triggers, and conditions for local automations without going through Home Assistant. The minimal-install variant (`tailscale-core.yaml`) leaves IDs to you.

### Binary sensors

| Entity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **VPN Connected** | `on` when the Tailscale state machine reports `CONNECTED` (WireGuard tunnel is up and the control plane has handshaken). Device class: `connectivity`. |
| **VPN Node Key Expiry Warning** | `on` when the node's key expiry is **enabled** (Tailscale SaaS: HA shows this as "Problem" — click "Disable key expiry" in the admin). `off` when expiry is disabled or not applicable (HA shows "OK"). On Headscale, node keys do not expire by default so this stays OFF. |
| **HA API Connected** | `on` when at least one Home Assistant API client is connected. Device class: `connectivity`. |
| **VPN Auto-Rollback** | `on` when HA is connected via Tailscale and turning off the VPN switch would trigger the 60 s dead-man's-switch rollback. `off` when HA is on LAN — the switch can be toggled freely. |

### Text sensors (diagnostic)

| Entity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **VPN IP** | The `100.x.y.z` address assigned to this node. Empty until connected. |
| **VPN Hostname** | The hostname this node registered with, e.g. `esp32-tailscale`. |
| **VPN MagicDNS** | The FQDN, e.g. `esp32-tailscale.tailXXXXX.ts.net` (Tailscale SaaS) or `esp32-tailscale.headscale.local` (Headscale with `magic_dns: true`). Unknown if MagicDNS is not configured on the control plane. |
| **VPN Network** | The tailnet domain, e.g. `tailXXXXX.ts.net` (Tailscale SaaS) or the Headscale `base_domain`. Unknown if not provided by the control plane. |
| **Device Memory** | Reports `PSRAM <size>KB` or `Internal RAM` so you can confirm PSRAM was detected. |
| **VPN Setup Hint** | Human-readable next-action hint, e.g. `wifi use_address: 100.x.y.z`. Shows auth-source-aware failure messages after 60 s, node key expiry deadline date when applicable, and clickable GitHub README links. |
| **VPN Peer Status** | `OK` / `Warning` / `Full` based on how close you are to the `max_peers` limit. |
| **VPN Node Key Expiry** | ISO-8601 timestamp of the node's key expiry (`device_class: timestamp`). Shows **Unknown** when key expiry is disabled (Tailscale SaaS: click "Disable key expiry") or not applicable (Headscale: no expiry by default). Unknown is the correct, healthy state. See the **VPN Node Key Expiry Warning** binary sensor for the simple on/off view. |
| **HA API Connection Route** | How the *currently-connected* HA instance is reaching the device: `Tailscale Direct`, `Tailscale DERP`, `Local`, or `Unknown`. Updates live. |
| **HA API Connection IP** | The IP address of the currently-connected HA API client. Deduplicated when multiple clients connect. |
| **VPN Control Plane** | Friendly name of the active control plane: `Tailscale` when using SaaS, `Headscale` when `login_server` points elsewhere. Static — set at boot. |
| **VPN Login Server** | The raw `login_server` YAML value (empty for Tailscale SaaS). Static — set at boot. |
| **VPN Auth Key Source** | Shows `Default (YAML)` when using the built-in auth key, or `Override (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)` with the timestamp when a runtime override is active. |

### Sensors

| Entity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **VPN Peers Online** | How many peers in the tailnet are currently reachable. |
| **VPN Peers Direct** | How many of those are on a direct WireGuard path (NAT traversal succeeded). |
| **VPN Peers DERP** | How many are going through Tailscale's DERP relays. Ideally zero. |
| **VPN Peers Max** | Your configured `max_peers` value. |
| **VPN Uptime** | Seconds since the `CONNECTED` state was entered. Resets on reconnect. Publishes every 5 s during the first 5 minutes, then every 60 s. |
| **VPN Connect Count** | Lifetime count of successful VPN connections since boot. Does not reset on reconnect. |

### Text inputs

| Entity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **VPN Auth Key Override** | Password-mode text input. Submit a new auth key (`tskey-auth-...` for Tailscale SaaS, `hskey-auth-...` for Headscale) to replace the YAML default at runtime — no reflash needed. The key is persisted in NVS across reboots. Submit an empty value to revert to the YAML default. See **VPN Auth Key Source** for which key is active. Max 128 characters. |

### Switches

| Entity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **VPN Enabled** | Stops the Tailscale stack when turned off. See [Enable switch caveats](#enable-switch-caveats) below. |
| **VPN Debug Log** | Toggles verbose microlink/VPN logging (INFO ↔ WARN). State persists across reboots via NVS. Only affects VPN-related log tags — ESPHome's own logs are unchanged. |

> **Note:** The debug log switch controls the *runtime* log level of the VPN components. Your ESPHome `logger: level:` setting still acts as a global ceiling — if you set it to `ERROR`, VPN debug logs won't appear even with the switch ON. The default `DEBUG` or `INFO` level works fine.

### Buttons

| Entity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **VPN Reconnect** | Triggers the three-phase reconnect state machine (rebind → full restart → reboot). Useful if you suspect the tunnel is wedged. |
| **Reboot** | Standard ESPHome restart button. |

---

## Configuration options

All options go under the `tailscale:` block:

```yaml
tailscale:
  auth_key: !secret tailscale_auth_key   # required
  hostname: "esp32-tailscale"            # optional, default empty → control plane auto-assigns
  max_peers: 16                          # optional, default 16, range 1–64

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `auth_key` | *(required)* | Tailscale auth key (`tskey-auth-...`). Use `!secret`. |
| `hostname` | `""` | Name the node registers as. Empty → Tailscale picks one. |
| `max_peers` | `16` | Maximum number of peers to track. Raise if your tailnet has more than 16 nodes (up to 64). |
| `login_server` | `""` | Custom control-plane host. Empty uses the official Tailscale SaaS coordinator. Set to a Headscale (or other Tailscale-compatible) coordinator to point the node elsewhere. Accepts a bare hostname, an IP, `host:port`, or a full `http://host[:port]` / `https://host[:port]` URL. HTTPS is validated against the ESP-IDF public-CA bundle (Let's Encrypt etc.; self-signed certs are not supported). Authentication and initial registration work end-to-end against Headscale 0.23.0; see *Custom control plane (Headscale)* under Deployment Notes for the current caveats. Leave empty for Tailscale SaaS. |
| `disable_telemetry` | `false` | Set to `true` to turn off the anonymous telemetry (see [Telemetry](#telemetry)). |
| `netcheck_override` | `false` | Measure the round-trip time to every DERP region and use the fastest one as the node's home relay, instead of the region the control plane reports. See *Picking the DERP region* below before enabling. |
| `netcheck_override_threshold` | `50ms` | Only switch when the measured region is at least this much faster than the current one. Ignored unless `netcheck_override` is `true`. Prevents flapping between regions with near-identical latency. |
| `netmap_buffer_kb` | *(unset → 512)* | Size in KB of **each** of the two PSRAM buffers used to fetch the netmap (HTTP/2 receive + JSON parse), so roughly twice this much contiguous PSRAM at once. The 512 KB default is sized for 300+ peer tailnets. On a 2 MB-PSRAM board, or one sharing PSRAM with a display/audio component, that allocation can fail and the device never gets past registration — set `128` (ample below ~50 peers). Range 64–2048. Leave unset unless you need it. |

> **No `update_interval`.** The component is fully event-driven: sensors publish only when the underlying state actually changes. There is no polling loop to tune — and nothing to reduce CPU/network cost by raising.

> **What about STUN / DISCO?** The Tailscale stack always runs **STUN** (to discover how your NAT maps outbound UDP) and **DISCO** (Tailscale's peer discovery / path-probing protocol) — they're essential for getting direct peer-to-peer connections. They can't be turned off in this component because microlink runs them unconditionally; they have no config knob.

## How it works

### The short version

The ESP32 runs [microlink](https://github.com/CamM2325/microlink), a C implementation of the Tailscale client protocol. microlink handles:

- control-plane registration (HTTPS to the Tailscale coordinator),
- WireGuard key exchange and tunnel setup,
- peer discovery (disco protocol),
- NAT traversal via STUN,
- fallback to DERP relays when direct paths fail,
- and lwIP integration so the ESP's network stack sees the `100.x` address as a normal interface.

This ESPHome component wraps microlink in a `PollingComponent`, feeds it your auth key, exposes the state it reports as Home Assistant entities, and integrates the lifecycle with the rest of ESPHome (WiFi wait, OTA hooks, reboot, etc.).

### Direct vs DERP

Tailscale tries to make every peer-to-peer connection a **direct** UDP path. When that fails (strict NAT, UDP-blocked networks, etc.) it falls back to **DERP**: relays operated by Tailscale that tunnel traffic for you. DERP is encrypted end-to-end — the relays only see ciphertext — but they add latency.

The `VPN Peers Direct` and `VPN Peers DERP` sensors tell you at a glance how your peers are connected. The `HA API Connection Route` sensor tells you specifically which path Home Assistant is using *right now*.

> **Note:** There is **no DERP switch**. microlink always needs DERP available as a fallback (it hardcodes this internally). Turning DERP off would only disrupt the tunnel without actually disabling DERP, so the switch was removed.

### Memory modes

On boot the component queries `esp_psram_get_size()` and reports one of two modes:

- **`PSRAM <size>KB`** — PSRAM detected and initialized; full peer list support, up to 64 peers. This is the required, working state.
- **`Internal RAM`** — PSRAM was **not** detected/initialized. **The device will not work in this mode**: the control-plane buffers can't be allocated, so it can't fetch the tailnet map. Fix PSRAM init — see [Troubleshooting](#device-memory-shows-internal-ram-even-though-your-board-has-psram) below.

Check the `Device Memory` sensor after first boot to confirm. If you expect PSRAM but see `Internal RAM`, see [Troubleshooting → `Device Memory` shows `Internal RAM` even though your board has PSRAM](#device-memory-shows-internal-ram-even-though-your-board-has-psram).

### HA Connection Route

This is the clever bit. When an ESPHome API client connects, the component walks the lwIP TCP PCB list, finds the pcb that owns the API connection, extracts the remote IP, and classifies it:

- If the remote IP is in the Tailscale CGNAT range (`100.64.0.0/10`), it looks up the peer in the microlink peer table and reports `Tailscale Direct` or `Tailscale DERP` based on whether the peer has a direct path.
- Otherwise it reports `Local`.

This gives you a live view of "is HA Core actually talking to me over Tailscale, or is it taking a LAN shortcut?" — invaluable when you're debugging a "why is my dashboard slow?" moment.

## Home Assistant integration

Once the device is added via the ESPHome integration, all entities show up under the device page. Here are a few useful things you can build on top:

### Dashboard card

```yaml

```

### Automation: warn if key expiry is still enabled

If you forget to disable key expiry on a new node, this automation checks every hour and warns you about **any** ESP device that still has key expiry enabled. Works automatically with multiple devices — no need to list entity IDs by hand.

```yaml
alias: Tailscale node key expiry check
trigger:
  - platform: time_pattern
    hours: "/1"
action:
  - variables:
      warnings: >
        {{ states.binary_sensor
           | selectattr('entity_id', 'search', '_vpn_node_key_expiry_warning$')
           | selectattr('state', 'eq', 'on')
           | map(attribute='entity_id')
           | list }}
  - condition: template
    value_template: "{{ warnings | length > 0 }}"
  - service: notify.mobile_app_phone
    data:
      title: "Tailscale key expiry still on"
      message: >
        {% for entity_id in warnings %}
        {% set device = device_attr(device_id(entity_id), 'name') %}
        {% set expiry_id = entity_id | replace('binary_sensor.', 'text_sensor.') | replace('_warning', '') %}
        - {{ device }}: expires {{ states(expiry_id) }}
        {% endfor %}
        Open the admin console and click "Disable key expiry" for each device.
```

## Deployment Notes

A collection of behaviors we've found easy to miss until they cause a surprise — and easier to get right on day one. These are not bugs; they are design consequences of how Tailscale and userspace WireGuard interact with a microcontroller endpoint.

### Subnet routers and the ESP node

If your network already has a Tailscale subnet router advertising the LAN CIDR that the ESP lives on, peers on the tailnet now see two paths to the device: one via the subnet router (arriving at the ESP's LAN address, NAT'd), and one direct (arriving at the ESP's own `100.x` tailnet address). The two paths are not equivalent, and Tailscale's route preference decides which one wins.

We recommend:

- Let the ESP join as its own tailnet node — that is the whole point of this component. The direct path is the one you want.
- Do **not** re-advertise the ESP's LAN CIDR through the subnet router purely to reach the device; it creates duplicate routing state and makes `HA API Connection Route` diagnostics ambiguous.
- Keep `accept_routes: false` on the ESP itself unless you specifically need another subnet. With `accept_routes: true`, the node honors advertised routes that can include its own LAN — a self-loop that never completes, and a source of flaky behavior that is hard to spot from the logs.

### Userspace WireGuard: what the node can and cannot do

> **Not the same thing as the HA Tailscale add-on's "Userspace networking" checkbox.** That one is about how the HA host exposes the tailnet to other add-ons and is covered in Troubleshooting → *[ESPHome add-on can't OTA or stream logs over Tailscale (HAOS)](#esphome-add-on-cant-ota-or-stream-logs-over-tailscale-haos)*. This section is about the **ESP32 node itself** — same adjective, different layer.

This component uses microlink, a userspace WireGuard stack. There is no kernel TUN device and no netfilter hook, which constrains what the Tailscale node is allowed to do compared with a full Linux `tailscaled`:

| Feature                  | Supported | Notes |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ----- |
| Join tailnet as leaf     | Yes       | This is the node's role. |
| `accept_routes`          | Yes       | Off by default. |
| Custom `login_server`    | Yes       | Headscale 0.23.0 verified end-to-end: Noise handshake, `/machine/register`, and the streaming MapResponse long-poll all work. See *Custom control plane (Headscale)* below. |
| Advertise subnet routes  | No        | The ESP cannot be a subnet router. |
| Exit node (use or offer) | No        | Neither direction is implemented. |
| Netfilter / ACL rules    | No        | There is no OS-level firewall to hook into. |

If your architecture requires the ESP to route traffic on behalf of other devices, it won't. Place a Linux subnet router alongside it and keep the ESP as a pure endpoint — that is the supported topology.

### Custom control plane (Headscale)

> **TL;DR:** `login_server` supports Headscale end-to-end, over plain HTTP or HTTPS (public-CA certs). The device completes the Noise handshake, registers, gets a tailnet IP, and stays online via the streaming MapResponse long-poll. Verified against Headscale 0.23.0.

By default the component registers against the official Tailscale SaaS coordinator at `controlplane.tailscale.com`. That is the recommended production path.

The `login_server` YAML option replaces the control-plane host microlink talks to, pointing the node at Headscale or any other Tailscale-compatible coordinator:

```yaml
tailscale:
  auth_key: "<preauth key from headscale>"
  hostname: "esp32-tailscale"
  login_server: "http://192.168.1.42:80"   # or bare IP / hostname / host:port / https://…
```

Accepted forms:

- Bare hostname or IP: `192.168.1.42`, `headscale.local`
- With explicit port: `192.168.1.42:8080`
- Full URL: `http://192.168.1.42`, `http://192.168.1.42:80`
- HTTPS URL: `https://headscale.example.com`, `https://headscale.example.com:8443` — the whole control-plane session (key fetch, Noise upgrade, register, long-poll) runs inside TLS. This is the right choice when Headscale sits behind a reverse proxy (Caddy, Traefik, nginx) that redirects HTTP to HTTPS.

**HTTPS certificate requirement:** the TLS connection is validated against the ESP-IDF **public-CA certificate bundle**. A certificate from Let's Encrypt or any other public CA works out of the box; **self-signed certificates and private CAs are not supported yet** — there is currently no `custom CA` / `skip verify` option. If your Headscale uses a self-signed cert, either front it with a public-CA cert or use plain `http://` on a trusted LAN.

**What works end-to-end against Headscale 0.23.0:**

- YAML → `tailscale.cpp` setter → `microlink_config_t.ctrl_host` → `ml->ctrl_host`.
- `host:port` parsing and HTTP `Host:` / HTTP/2 `:authority` header construction.
- Noise server public key is fetched at setup time from the Tailscale-compatible `/key?v=88` HTTP endpoint and passed into `ml_noise_init`, so the IK handshake completes against a Headscale-generated keypair.
- `/machine/register` over HTTP/2 — the node receives its tailnet IP from Headscale and appears in `headscale nodes list` (typically `100.64.0.1` on a fresh install).
- The streaming `/machine/map` long-poll stays open and delivers delta `MapResponse` chunks in response to each periodic endpoint update, so the node stays "online" in Headscale between STUN re-probes.

**One more thing to watch for:**

- **Auth keys come from the coordinator that issues them.** A Tailscale SaaS `tskey-auth-...` will not work against Headscale, and vice versa. Generate the key on the same coordinator you will connect to. Headscale / Headplane generates keys with a `hskey-auth-...` prefix (older CLI versions may output raw hex).
- **Switching between Tailscale SaaS and Headscale** (or vice versa) requires both a new `login_server` value in the YAML and a matching auth key. The auth key can be changed at runtime via the **VPN Auth Key Override** entity in HA — no reflash needed for the key itself. However, changing `login_server` requires a YAML edit and reflash.

For the full reproduction — docker-compose, a minimal `config.yaml`, and the CLI commands to create a user and preauth key — see [`contrib/headscale-test/README.md`](contrib/headscale-test/README.md). That directory is intentionally not shipped via the `packages:` distribution.

### Auth key and node key expiry

Two settings in the admin panel (Tailscale Admin Console or Headplane UI) decide whether an unattended ESP stays healthy:

1. **Node key expiry.** On **Tailscale SaaS**, each machine's key expires after 180 days by default. When that happens the device drops off the tailnet until re-authentication. Disable key expiry per device right after first boot: *Machines → device → ⋯ → Disable key expiry*. The `VPN Node Key Expiry Warning` binary sensor will flip off once it is done. On **Headscale**, node keys do not expire by default (the server sends Go's zero time as expiry). No action needed — the `VPN Node Key Expiry` sensor shows Unknown and the warning stays OFF, which is the correct steady state.
2. **Auth key flags.** When generating the key used in `secrets.yaml`, we recommend:
   - **Pre-authorized**, so the node joins without manual approval.
   - **Non-ephemeral**, so the machine entry persists across reboots. Ephemeral nodes are wiped while offline and reappear as new entries every boot, quickly cluttering the admin panel.
   - **Reusable** if the same firmware is flashed to multiple devices; single-use for tighter provisioning control.
   - **Long expiry** on the key itself. The auth key is only consumed at first boot, but a short expiry window can bite if a replacement device sits on a shelf for a few months before deployment.

### First boot vs subsequent boots

At first boot the component reads the auth key, performs the tailnet join, and persists the resulting node key to NVS. Every subsequent boot reuses that node key, which is why the same device appears as the same machine across power cycles.

Three scenarios cause the device to appear as a new machine on the tailnet:

- **`esptool erase_flash`** wipes NVS and forces a fresh join. The old machine entry in the admin panel becomes orphaned and should be deleted manually.
- **Changing `hostname`** in the YAML. From Tailscale's perspective this is a new node; the old entry lingers with the old name until deleted.
- **Deleting the device in the admin console** (Tailscale Admin or Headplane UI / `headscale nodes delete`). If the auth key is **reusable and still valid**, the device will automatically re-register with the same IP — no action needed. If the auth key is **single-use or expired**, the device will fail to connect ("Connection failed" in Setup Hint). To fix this, either enter a new auth key via the **VPN Auth Key Override** entity in HA, or erase NVS (`esptool erase_flash` or ESPHome's "Clean Build Files" + reflash) and provide a fresh auth key in the YAML.

Clean up orphans when renaming or reflashing. It is easy to accumulate ghost machines otherwise.

### Direct connections versus DERP relays

Tailscale prefers direct peer-to-peer UDP connections and falls back to DERP relays when NAT traversal fails. The fallback is transparent but has measurable cost:

- DERP paths add roughly 50–150 ms of latency depending on the nearest relay.
- DERP bandwidth is subject to Tailscale's fair-use caps.
- Sustained high-frequency telemetry over DERP works, but is noticeably slower than direct.

What usually prevents a direct connection:

- **CGNAT or symmetric NAT** on either end — common on mobile carriers and some residential ISPs — makes UDP hole punching fail. The node still works; it will simply always relay.
- **Outbound UDP 41641** must be reachable for the initial handshake. Most consumer networks allow this; some restricted corporate networks do not.
- **Hairpin NAT** on the local router affects whether a peer on the same LAN can reach the ESP via its tailnet IP while both are local.

How to tell which mode is in use: the `HA API Connection Route` text sensor reports `Tailscale Direct` or `Tailscale DERP` for the current HA session, and the serial log emits the same classification per peer.

#### Mobile hotspots and CGNAT

On phone tethering or carrier-grade NAT, the coordinator still advertises each peer's direct UDP endpoint, but packets sent there are sometimes silently dropped. The component handles this automatically with **no configuration required**: the first outbound TCP connection over the VPN fails fast with an ESP-IDF socket error (errno 113), the component triggers a fresh WireGuard handshake, flips outbound routing onto DERP, and retries once. The second attempt succeeds. You see roughly a 3-second one-time delay in the log; after that the tunnel behaves normally for the rest of the session.

Home-WiFi and direct-UDP-reachable networks are unaffected — the self-heal branch is only taken when the first connect actually fails, so the fast direct path stays fast there.

Direct UDP can still work through CGNAT for peers with publicly reachable endpoints (cloud VMs, VPS, datacenter servers). Symmetric NAT on both ends is what actually breaks hole-punching; a one-sided CGNAT is usually traversable.

### Picking the DERP region

Every node tells the control plane which DERP region is its *home relay* — the one other peers dial when they cannot reach it directly. This component reports the region the control plane last gave it, and the built-in fallback is region 4 (Frankfurt). For a device in Europe that is fine. For a device far from it, every relayed connection crosses a continent: measurements from a board in Australia showed ~700–900 ms to Frankfurt where Sydney answered in ~50 ms, and an OTA update over the relay took **498 s instead of 26 s**.

Setting `netcheck_override: true` makes the device measure the round-trip time to every region in the tailnet's DERP map and adopt the fastest one as its home relay:

```yaml
tailscale:
  auth_key: !secret tailscale_auth_key
  netcheck_override: true
  netcheck_override_threshold: 50ms   # only switch if it's at least this much faster
```

It is off by default because a home-region change has to be announced to every peer before it takes effect, so switching is disruptive, and on a device already near the default region there is nothing to gain. Turn it on when the device is far from Frankfurt and relays (rather than connects directly) to its peers — a device that always has direct paths never uses its home relay at all.

The threshold exists to prevent flapping: with two regions of near-identical latency, a device that re-picks on every measurement would keep re-announcing itself, and each announcement is a window where peers are still dialling the old region. Raise it if you see the home region changing repeatedly in the log; lower it only if a genuinely better region is being ignored.

Self-hosted Headscale usually publishes exactly one (embedded) region, in which case this option has nothing to choose between and changes nothing.

### Hardware realities

Development and automated validation happen on ESP32-S3 with PSRAM. Other variants are documented as possible by the underlying libraries, but are not currently verified here.

- **PSRAM is required.** The WireGuard crypto buffers, microlink's internal state, and the ESPHome runtime together exceed what stock ESP32 internal RAM can provide — in particular the control-plane buffers can't be allocated from internal RAM, so without PSRAM the device won't connect at all.
- **CPU caps WireGuard throughput at roughly 2–5 Mbit/s** on ESP32-S3. This is ample for sensor telemetry and MQTT payloads, but too slow for image or video streaming through the tailnet.
- **Flash 4 MB minimum, 8 MB or more recommended.** OTA requires enough free flash to hold a second firmware image alongside the running one.

If a particular variant matters to you, running `esphome compile` on the example config is the fastest way to check whether it fits: a failed build names the constraint that was hit.

### Large tailnets: scope the device with ACLs

Unlike `tailscaled`, which establishes WireGuard sessions lazily when there is actual traffic for a peer, this component handshakes **eagerly across every peer in its netmap** — each visible peer costs a session slot (~0.9 KB), periodic DISCO probes, and continuous WireGuard handshake retries toward peers that never answer. On a large tailnet this adds up: an 85-node tailnet has been measured at ~1,000 handshake attempts per hour toward dozens of peers the device never talks to.

The right fix is a [tailnet ACL](https://tailscale.com/kb/1018/acls) that lets the device see only the peers it actually needs (typically one or two hosts). This cuts radio and CPU cost, frees peer slots, and shrinks every netmap the device has to parse. `max_peers` caps the table size, but an ACL is what stops the chatter at the source.

### ESPHome package cache

When loading the component via `packages:` from a GitHub source, ESPHome caches the fetched content for 24 hours by default. During active development against `main`, this can hide newly pushed changes for a full day.

Three ways around it:

- Add `refresh: always` to the `packages:` block (equivalent to `refresh: 0s`), which bypasses the 24-hour cache and refetches on every compile.
- Click **Clean All Files** in the ESPHome Dashboard top bar — this wipes cached build artifacts and external packages for every configuration, straight from the web UI.
- Delete `.esphome/external_components/` and `.esphome/packages/` manually between compiles.

End users who pin to a released tag or a specific commit do not need any of these workarounds — it only matters when tracking `main` actively.

## Known limitations

### Tailnet lock

**Not supported.** [Tailnet lock](https://tailscale.com/kb/1226/tailnet-lock) requires the client to embed a `NodeKeySignature` in its `/machine/register` payload when joining, and to verify Ed25519-signed peer NKS entries from each `MapResponse` before bringing up WireGuard tunnels. The upstream [microlink](https://github.com/CamM2325/microlink) library this component wraps implements neither — its registration payload has no `NodeKeySignature` field, and its crypto stack (curve25519 only) has no Ed25519 verifier linked in.

If your tailnet has lock enabled, ESP32 nodes added through this component will not successfully join. The "Sign machine" flow in the admin panel and the pre-signed auth key flow both rely on the same underlying protocol features and will not help.

Specifically on the pre-signed auth key path (`tailscale lock sign $AUTH_KEY` → wrapped key in the form `tskey-auth-XXXXXXX--TL{...}`): the `--TL{...}` suffix is **not an opaque token**. It carries a client-side crypto payload — a `SigCredential` (a `NodeKeySignature` endorsing a single-use Ed25519 public key) plus the matching single-use Ed25519 **private** key. On first connect, a Tailscale client must unwrap the blob, Ed25519-sign its own node key with the embedded private key (a `SigRotation` signature), and emit a complete `NodeKeySignature` chain in `RegisterRequest`. Microlink today has no Ed25519 primitive (only X25519), no NKS struct, and no register-side field for it — so a longer auth-key buffer alone is not sufficient. Wire-format reference: [tailscale/tailscale#7431](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/pull/7431).

Workarounds, roughly best → worst:

1. **Disable tailnet lock in the Tailscale admin panel**, if you don't have a specific threat-model reason to keep it on. This is the simplest unblock. Note it's a one-way-ish operation — disabling invalidates your existing signing keys, and re-enabling later means re-signing every node in the tailnet from scratch.
2. **Keep lock on your main tailnet, put ESP32 devices in a separate unlocked tailnet** and bridge between them. Preserves lock where you want it, but adds a tailnet to manage.
3. **Wait for upstream microlink support.** If you'd like to track or push for the feature, the right place is an issue on the [microlink repo](https://github.com/CamM2325/microlink).

## Troubleshooting

### The device won't connect at all

Check the serial log for the state machine output. You should cycle through `IDLE → WIFI_WAIT → CONNECTING → REGISTERING → CONNECTED`.

| Stuck at | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `IDLE` | microlink never started | WiFi not connected — check WiFi logs |
| `WIFI_WAIT` | WiFi still joining | Wait or check SSID/password |
| `CONNECTING` | Can't reach control plane | Check DNS and internet connectivity on the LAN |
| `REGISTERING` | Control plane rejected the auth key | Key expired, used on too many devices, or the tailnet has device approval on — check the Tailscale admin (or Headplane UI / `headscale` CLI for Headscale) |
| `ERROR` | microlink crash | See serial log for details; try `VPN Reconnect` button or reboot |

### `Found multiple SNTP configurations but id is inconsistent` at validation

The package ships its own SNTP time source (`time: platform: sntp` with `id: tailscale_time`) because microlink needs a valid wall clock (TLS certificate validation, key-expiry math). If your own YAML **also** declares a `time: - platform: sntp` block, ESPHome rejects the config with this error. Don't delete either block — **extend** the package's instead ([#26](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/26)):

```yaml
time:
  - platform: sntp
    id: !extend tailscale_time   # merge into the package's SNTP instead of adding a second one
    # your own keys merge in as usual:
    servers:
      - hu.pool.ntp.org
    on_time:
      - seconds: 0
        minutes: /5
        then:
          - logger.log: "5 minutes passed"
```

### `Device Memory` shows `Internal RAM` even though your board has PSRAM

ESPHome's `psram:` component needs to know your specific PSRAM type and clock speed to initialize it correctly. The `esp32-s3-devkitc-1` board defaults assume **octal 80MHz** PSRAM, which matches `N8R8` / `N16R8` modules but **not** the cheaper `N8R2` / `N16R2` variants (quad 40MHz). Listings often label all of these as "WROOM-1" without making the difference clear, and an N8R2 board sold as "N16R8" is a common mismatch.

If `Device Memory` reads `Internal RAM` but you believe your board has PSRAM, add an explicit `psram:` block to your YAML:

```yaml
# For N8R8 / N16R8 modules (8 MB Octal PSRAM, most common high-end variant):
psram:
  mode: octal
  speed: 80MHz

# For N8R2 / N16R2 modules (2 MB Quad PSRAM, cheaper variant):
psram:
  mode: quad
  speed: 40MHz
```

After flashing, the `Device Memory` sensor should report `PSRAM XXkB` and the VPN should connect normally.

**If you don't know which variant your board is**, the safe path is trial-and-error: try `mode: octal speed: 80MHz` first (most common ESP32-S3 dev boards are `N8R8` / `N16R8` octal), reflash, check the sensor. If it still says `Internal RAM`, switch to `mode: quad speed: 40MHz` and reflash again. One of the two will work — ESPHome's `psram:` block **forces the configured mode**, it does not auto-detect or fall back, so an octal chip configured for quad mode (or vice versa) simply fails to initialize PSRAM. Reported and resolved in [#9](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/9).

### Can I run this on a board with no PSRAM (e.g. by disabling the PSRAM check)?

**No — PSRAM is a hard requirement, and forcing the check off does not help.** The control-plane (HTTP/2 + JSON) buffers are a fixed 512 KB each and cannot be allocated from internal RAM, so a board without PSRAM never fetches the tailnet map and never connects ([#9](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/9)).

A few forks patch the component to hardcode the detected PSRAM size to `0` (forcing the "no PSRAM" code path), hoping it enables a small-buffer mode. **That small-buffer mode was never implemented**, so the patch only guarantees the device can't connect — don't do it. If `Device Memory` reads `Internal RAM` on a board that *does* have PSRAM, that's a PSRAM init/config issue (see the section above), not a reason to bypass the check.

Use any ESP32 with PSRAM (e.g. ESP32-S3 `N8R8` / `N16R8` / `N8R2` / `N16R2`).

### Registration succeeds but the device never connects (`MapRequest failed, will retry`)

If the log shows a clean registration (`Registered as User.ID=…`) and then `MapRequest failed, will retry` **within a few milliseconds** of `[TIMING] MapRequest send`, looping forever, the netmap buffers could not be allocated. Fetching the netmap needs two PSRAM buffers of `netmap_buffer_kb` each (512 KB by default): on a 2 MB-PSRAM board, or one where a display/audio/camera component already holds most of PSRAM, the allocation returns NULL and the fetch fails instantly — a network round-trip could never fail that fast.

From v0.5.7 the cause is stated explicitly in the log (`cannot allocate … KB - PSRAM free … KB (largest block … KB)`), and a warning is printed at boot when the free PSRAM already looks too small. The fix is to lower the buffers:

```yaml
tailscale:
  netmap_buffer_kb: 128     # each buffer; ample for tailnets below ~50 peers
```

On an older release the same thing can be done through the ESP-IDF options directly:

```yaml
esp32:
  framework:
    type: esp-idf
    sdkconfig_options:
      CONFIG_ML_H2_BUFFER_SIZE_KB: "128"
      CONFIG_ML_JSON_BUFFER_SIZE_KB: "128"
```

If it still fails at 128 KB, the board genuinely has no room left — free PSRAM elsewhere in the config, or move Tailscale to its own board.

### The device reboots every 30–40 s after connecting, and an OTA "reverts itself"

If the serial log ends with `task_wdt: Task watchdog got triggered … - loopTask` and `CPU 1: ml_wg_mgr`, a peer is probing this node hard enough that the DISCO/WireGuard manager starved ESPHome's main loop for more than 5 seconds. Since v0.5.7 the manager budgets its work per iteration so the main loop always gets CPU, and logs one `DISCO: N packets in 10 s …` line per 10 seconds while it lasts; if you still see that line reporting many packets per second, look for the peer that never completes a WireGuard session with this node ([#46](https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale/issues/46)). Since v0.5.8 the node also backs off by itself — it no longer answers a CallMeMaybe with one of its own and does not heartbeat a peer it has no WireGuard session with — so a storm like that can only be kept up by an older microlink build on the other end; updating that node ends it. Note that the ESPHome API log stream drops the last lines before an abort — only the UART shows the watchdog report.

### Auth key expired

Symptom: the log shows `State: ERROR` / `REGISTERING` failing after a fresh flash, the `VPN Connected` binary sensor never turns on, and the admin console (Tailscale or Headplane) shows no new machine. This usually means the pre-authentication key you baked into the firmware has expired or been revoked.

1. Generate a new auth key (Tailscale: [Quick Start step 1](#1-create-a-tailscale-auth-key); Headscale: Headplane UI → "Create pre-auth key" or `headscale preauthkeys create --user <user>`).
2. **Option A — no reflash:** paste the new key into the **VPN Auth Key Override** text entity in HA (Settings → Devices → your ESP → Controls). The device reconnects immediately with the new key, which is persisted in NVS across reboots. The **VPN Auth Key Source** sensor will show `Override (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)`.
3. **Option B — reflash:** update `secrets.yaml` and re-flash (OTA if reachable, otherwise USB).
4. **Disable key expiry on the new node** right away so it doesn't happen again. The `VPN Node Key Expiry Warning` binary sensor will flip to `off` once you do.

> **Note:** The `VPN Node Key Expiry` sensor reflects the *node* key expiry (received from the control plane), not the auth key used to register the device. Auth key expiry is never sent to the device, so it can't be monitored from HA. On Headscale, node keys do not expire by default — the sensor shows Unknown and the warning stays OFF, which is normal.

### HA can't reach the device after OTA

Symptom: you pushed an OTA update, the device rebooted, and now HA shows it as unavailable.

Almost always this means `use_address` isn't pinned to the Tailscale IP. ESPHome used LAN mDNS to find the device during OTA, but Home Assistant is configured to reach it at a different address.

**Fix:** set `wifi: use_address: "100.x.y.z"` in the YAML, re-flash once over USB (or if the device comes back briefly after reboot, over OTA), and from then on every connection goes through the tailnet.

### "Peer limit FULL" warnings in the log

Symptom: log lines like `Peer limit FULL: 16/16 online peers. Increase max_peers or remove unused peers from your tailnet.`

Increase `max_peers`:

```yaml
tailscale:
  auth_key: !secret tailscale_auth_key
  max_peers: 32  # or 48, or 64
```

PSRAM is required regardless; a higher `max_peers` just uses more memory (64 is the hard cap; each slot costs ~1 KB in the peer tables).

> **Version note:** on **0.5.1 and earlier**, `max_peers` above 16 did not actually take effect in the WireGuard layer — peers 17+ were discovered (Tailscale `ping` answered) but could never carry TCP, and *which* 16 peers worked was re-shuffled every boot. If you run a tailnet with more than 16 nodes, update to a release newer than 0.5.1 before raising this value.

### `HA API Connection Route` shows `Tailscale (unknown)`

This means HA is connecting from a `100.x` address, but the ESP doesn't have that peer in its peer table yet. Usually a transient state right after startup — wait for the next peer callback and it'll resolve to `Tailscale Direct` or `Tailscale DERP`.

### `HA API Connection Route` shows `Local` when you expect Tailscale

This means Home Assistant (or the ESPHome Builder, etc.) is reaching the device via its LAN IP, not the Tailscale IP. Either:

- `use_address` is still set to a LAN address — fix as above
- HA has cached a LAN address discovered via mDNS — restart the ESPHome integration or clear HA's zeroconf cache

### Builder UI can't find the device over Tailscale

Home Assistant's ESPHome add-on builder uses zeroconf / mDNS, which doesn't cross the tailnet boundary cleanly. Workaround: in the add-on UI add the device manually by its `100.x` IP, or run the ESPHome CLI from a machine that's on your tailnet.

### ESPHome add-on can't OTA or stream logs over Tailscale (HAOS)

Symptom: `use_address` is set to the device's `100.x` Tailscale IP, but the ESPHome dashboard shows the device as offline, OTA uploads time out, and log streaming never connects.

This almost always means the Tailscale add-on is running in its default **userspace networking** mode, which keeps the VPN tunnel isolated inside the Tailscale container. The ESPHome add-on (and every other add-on) runs in a separate container and cannot see the `100.x.x.x` routes.

**Fix:** Go to **Settings → Add-ons → Tailscale → Configuration** and set **"Userspace networking"** to **OFF**, then restart the add-on. This moves the Tailscale interface to the host network stack, which all add-ons share. After the restart, `ping 100.x.y.z` from the HA terminal should succeed, and the ESPHome dashboard will be able to reach the device.

This only affects Home Assistant OS and Supervised installs using the Tailscale add-on.

**What you give up by disabling userspace mode:** very little on HAOS. The Tailscale add-on container runs with `NET_ADMIN` and adds the `100.64.0.0/10` tailnet to the host routing table — slightly more privileged, but the add-on is trusted. The tailnet also becomes visible to every other add-on instead of only to the Tailscale one. In return you gain: other add-ons can reach tailnet peers, MagicDNS resolves from the host, and exit-node / subnet-router features become available if you ever want them. Userspace mode is mainly a portability fallback for hosts that can't provide a TUN device — HAOS can, so kernel mode is the right choice here.

## Enable switch caveats

The `VPN Enabled` switch really does stop the microlink stack when turned off — but there's one gotcha:

**If Home Assistant is reaching the ESP *only* through Tailscale** (no LAN path), then turning the switch off will kill HA's own connection to the device. The component has a 60-second dead-man's-switch safety: if HA doesn't re-establish a connection within 60 seconds, the switch rolls back to its previous state automatically.

In practice this means:
- **On LAN:** the switch works as expected. Turn it off, Tailscale goes away, HA still reaches the device over LAN. Stays off.
- **Tailscale-only:** you *can* turn it off but it'll snap back after a minute. If you really want it off in this scenario, you need to reboot the device or re-enable from LAN.

The switch state also **does not persist across reboots** — the device always boots with Tailscale enabled. This is a deliberate safety choice so a bad toggle can't leave the device unreachable forever.

## Development

If you want to modify the component:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Csontikka/esphome-tailscale.git
cd esphome-tailscale
```

The `microlink/` directory is vendored directly into the repository, so no `git submodule` step is needed.

The repository ships two example configurations at the root:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [`example.yaml`](example.yaml) | End-user style. Pulls the component and entities from the GitHub `packages:` source — exactly what someone installing this would write. |
| [`example-dev.yaml`](example-dev.yaml) | Development style. Uses `external_components: - source: components` so every compile picks up the working-tree copy of the code, with the entity definitions inlined. This is the file to use when editing `components/tailscale/`. |

Build and flash the dev example:

```bash
esphome run example-dev.yaml --device COM3
```

The `components/tailscale/` directory is the external component proper; `microlink/` is a vendored copy of [CamM2325/microlink](https://github.com/CamM2325/microlink) (via the [Csontikka/microlink](https://github.com/Csontikka/microlink) fork) which provides the Tailscale protocol stack. It is checked in directly rather than pulled as a submodule, so a fresh clone is ready to build with no extra steps.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need a subnet router?**
No. That's the whole point. The ESP is its own Tailscale node.

**Q: Can I use the ESP as a subnet router / Tailscale connector / TCP forwarder?**
No. This component makes the ESP itself a Tailscale node — it does not advertise subnet routes, forward TCP between the tailnet and your LAN, or act as a connector. The microlink library does not implement subnet route advertisement, and lwIP on ESP32 isn't set up for IP forwarding / NAT. If you need to expose other LAN devices to your tailnet, run a real subnet router on that network: a Pi Zero 2 W, an OpenWrt / GL.iNet / Mikrotik router with the Tailscale package, or a Home Assistant instance with the Tailscale add-on in subnet-router mode.

**Q: Do I need Tailscale Funnel?**
No. Funnel publishes services to the public internet — that's unrelated. Everything here is private, tailnet-only.

**Q: Can I use this on a plain ESP32 (not S3)?**
Active testing happens on ESP32-S3 with PSRAM — that's the only chip this project currently verifies. The underlying microlink library claims support for other ESP32 variants, but they are **not yet verified here**. PSRAM is required regardless, because the Tailscale stack is too heavy for stock ESP32 RAM alone.

**Q: Will this work over cellular / LTE / a hotspot?**
Yes, as long as outbound UDP and HTTPS are allowed. DERP (TCP 443) is used as a fallback so even heavily-firewalled networks usually work.

**Q: How much flash does it use?**
The compiled firmware (including the full Tailscale stack) is around **1 MB**. A stock **4 MB** flash chip is plenty — it holds the bootloader, two OTA slots for that ~1 MB image, and still has room left for a small SPIFFS/LittleFS partition. 8 MB / 16 MB boards only matter if you plan to stack other large components next to Tailscale.

**Q: Can I run multiple ESPs on the same auth key?**
Yes, if the auth key is marked **Reusable** in the admin console (Tailscale Admin or Headplane UI). Each ESP will get its own `100.x` address.

**Q: My tailnet has ACLs. Do I need to grant the ESP access to HA?**
Yes, Home Assistant needs to be allowed to reach the ESP's API port (default `6053`). If you use tags, tag the ESP when generating the auth key (e.g. `tag:esphome`) and write an ACL rule allowing your HA host (or your whole tailnet) to reach `tag:esphome:*`.

**Q: Can I use this with Headscale (self-hosted)?**
Yes. Set `login_server` to your Headscale URL and use a preauth key from the Headplane UI or `headscale preauthkeys create`. See [Custom control plane (Headscale)](#custom-control-plane-headscale) for details. Verified end-to-end against Headscale 0.23.0.

**Q: Do I need to disable key expiry on Headscale too?**
No. Headscale does not expire node keys by default — the **VPN Node Key Expiry Warning** sensor stays OFF and the **VPN Node Key Expiry** sensor shows Unknown, which is the correct, healthy state. You only need to worry about key expiry on Tailscale SaaS.

**Q: Can I switch between Tailscale SaaS and Headscale?**
Yes, but it requires a YAML edit (`login_server`) and a reflash. The auth key can be changed at runtime via the **VPN Auth Key Override** entity — no reflash needed for the key itself. The old machine entry on the previous control plane becomes orphaned and should be deleted.

**Q: Can I ping the ESP from another tailnet node?**
Yes. Once connected, it responds to ICMP on its `100.x` address like any other Tailscale node. Great for sanity checks.

## Telemetry

The component sends a small **anonymous** telemetry event to a Cloudflare Worker on boot, then roughly once a day. It is **on by default**; to turn it off, set `disable_telemetry: true` under `tailscale:`.

The entire payload is: an anonymous device id (first 8 bytes of `SHA-256(WiFi MAC + fixed salt)` — one-way, cannot be reversed to the MAC), the component version, event type (`boot`/`heartbeat`), chip model + revision, uptime, boot count, reset reason, whether PSRAM is present, and whether the node is connected to the tailnet. It **never** sends the MAC, WiFi SSID, IP address, tailnet name, peer information, or your auth key. The device sends no IP; the receiving Worker stores only coarse geo (country/region from the Cloudflare edge), never the IP. The implementation is `components/tailscale/telemetry.{h,cpp}` and the backend is `telemetry/worker.js`.

```yaml
tailscale:
  auth_key: !secret tailscale_auth_key
  disable_telemetry: true   # opt out
```
